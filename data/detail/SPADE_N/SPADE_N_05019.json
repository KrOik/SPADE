                "Abstract": "This invention relates to the purification of a family of insecticidally effective peptides isolated from the spider, Calisoga sp., characterized by their neurotoxic effect on insect pest and low mammalian toxicity. The cDNA sequences for three of these peptides have been isolated, and the complete coding sequence is provided. This invention also discloses methods for producing recombinant peptides, as well as methods of utilizing these peptides as insecticidal agents."
