                "Abstract": "The invention concerns an antimicrobial peptide, called myticin, characterised in that it can be obtained from a bivalve mollusc shellfish, and its molecular mass is about 4.5 kDa; its pI is about 8.7; it comprises 8 cystein radicals. The invention also concerns its preparation and its uses. The invention further concerns a nucleic acid coding for said peptide."
