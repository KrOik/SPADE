            "Function": "Slow-binding inhibitor of serine proteases. The inhibitor rapidly binds to the protease forming a weak enzyme-inhibitor complex, and this is followed by a slow isomerization forming a tight-binding enzyme-inhibitor complex. Active against subtilisin A, perkinsin and trypsin with dissociation constants of 0.29 nM, 13.7 nM and 17.7 nM respectively. Not active against thermolysin, papain or pepsin. Has antiparasitic activity against the protozoan P. marinus.",
            "Tissue specificity": "Detected in hemolymph (at protein level). In oysters collected in the summer the expression level is highest in the digestive gland with low levels of expression in gill, mantle, labial palp, style-sac midgut, gonad, heart, and hemocyte. In winter expression levels are higher in all tissues with highest expression levels observed in the digestive gland. Within the digestive gland expression is limited to the basophil cells of the digestive diverticula.",
