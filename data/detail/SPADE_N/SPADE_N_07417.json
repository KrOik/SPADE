                "Abstract": "The invention relates to a cyclo-chromo-threo-valine-bright-leucine peptide (Trp-Thr-Val-Leu-Leu cyclic peptide) with hepatotoxicity and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity and a preparation method thereof, belonging to the technical field of extraction and preparation of biological products. The cyclotryptophan-threo-valine-leucine peptide is composed of tryptophan, threonine and valineLeucine and leucine, and pentadecane pentapeptide connected via amide bond. This is a novel compound and has not been reported in the literature. The compound of the invention can be obtained by culturing ranunculus japonicus and then extracting and separating. The pure product of the cyclo-threo-valine-leucine peptide is white powder, and has half-Inhibitory Concentration (IC) on liver cancer cell HepG2 50 ) Comprises the following steps: 51.50. Mu.g/mL, half inhibitory concentration of alpha-glucosidase (IC) 50 ) Comprises the following steps: 140.81. Mu.g/mL. The compound can be used as a potential drug for tr"
