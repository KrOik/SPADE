            "Function": "Antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Peptide which can recruit, activate and subsequently lyse human neutrophils, thus eliminating the main cellular defense against infection. Stimulates the secretion of the chemotactic factor interleukin-8 (IL-8). The ensuing activation process triggers an inflammatory response in the host, thus contributing greatly to virulence. Also possesses hemolytic activity, which may contribute to the development of disease. Peptide production is higher in most prevalent community-associated MRSA strains than in hospital-associated MRSA strains.",
