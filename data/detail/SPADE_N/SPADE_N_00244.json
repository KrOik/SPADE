                "Abstract": "Antimicrobial proteins capable of isolation from seeds of Heuchera or Aesculus show a wide range of antifungal activity and some activity against Gram-positive bacteria. DNA encoding the proteins may be isolated and incorporated into vectors. Plants transformed with this DNA may be produced. The proteins find commercial application as antifungal or antibacterial agents; transformed plants will show increased disease-resistance."
