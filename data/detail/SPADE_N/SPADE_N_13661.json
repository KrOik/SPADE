            "Comments": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (75.8%) toBrevinin-2GHk. It is obtained by truncating the C-terminal residues beyond 26 of BR2GK followed by C-terminal amidation.Activity: Interestingly, this 25-residue peptide gained both activity and cell selectivity. Broadly active against Gram+, Gram-, and fungi such as S. aureus, E. faecalis, MRSA, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and C. albicans.MOA: it can permeate membranes.Toxicity:  HMEC-1 cells IC50 >100 uM. Less hemo.lytic: HC50 >256 uM.SAR: Since this truncated peptide is less toxic than the parent peptide (AP3166), the future peptide development interest lies in this truncated form. Note that the helical conformation of  BR2GK(1-25)a is lost once L14 is converted to P14. Corresponding, the peptide became inactive, implying the importance of helical structure for antibacterial actvity. Updated 7/2021; 2/2022",
