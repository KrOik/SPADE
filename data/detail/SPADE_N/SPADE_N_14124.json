The A15L change made V6 more hydrophobic.Activity: active against B. cinerea (MIC 6 uM).Recombinant production:yeast:Pichia pastoris:  activity tested using recombinant peptide.Antimicrobial robustness: KCl-insensitive:B. cinerea (100 mM), CaCl2-insensitive:B. cinerea (2 mM). The creation of a cationic surface via mutations made the peptide more competitive than cation in bacterial targeting.Plant protection:N. benthamiana: MtDef4_V6 was more potent in reducing lesions formed by the grey mould disease than either MtDef4 or MtDef4_V5.",
