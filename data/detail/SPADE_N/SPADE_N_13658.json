Activity is pH-insensitive (2-12), lysozyme, DNase I, and RNase A, but inactivated by proteinase K. heat-stable after incubation at 100 oC for 30 mi and retained 72% activity by autoclavin at 121 oC for 30 min.Activity: Active against M. tuberculosis (MIC 7.5 ug/mL) (Anti-TB), M. smegmatis (MIC 2.5 ug/mL), acid-fast.  At 4x MIC, it is able to kill 99.99% M. smegmatis in 8 h.Animal model:mouse:  relative light unit (RLU) exhibited a significant decrease (injected daily at 30 ug/ml, 200 uL for 6 days).",
