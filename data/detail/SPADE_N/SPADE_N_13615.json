            "Comments": "Discovery: purified reduced peptide chain, after synthesis, was refolded by resuspending in 2 mL of 0.05 M Tris-Base buffer pH 8.0 containing 2M guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and 1 mM reduced glutathione (GSH)/0.1 mM oxidized glutathione (GSSG), as redox pair. After dilution, the oxidized defensin was purified on HPLC.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is most similar (52.6%) tohBD-28. Mol Wt: 3732.464; GRAVY: -1.48; Mol formula: C154H265N50O42S6, Molar Ex Coeff: 7415.Activity: Active against S. aureus ATCC25923 (MIC 12.5 uM), E. coli ATCC25922 (MIC 25 uM), and M. tuberculosis  H37Rv or MDR (MIC 8.8-25.9 uM) (anti-TB). In culture broth, it only showed a bacteriostatic effect.Structure: It consists of three beta strands: C3-C29, C9-C23, and C13-C30 similar hBD-1. The helical region is not as clear.You can rotate, zoom, and view the complex structure with ribosomeherein the PDB.SAR: the lack of a helical region may also explains its lower antibacterial activity than other defensins. Restoration of this helix in future design may gain activity against resistant Gram- strains.Toxicity: human RBC: not hemo.lytic (<2%) at 100 ug/ml.Updated 12/2019; 7/2021; 11/2023 GW",
