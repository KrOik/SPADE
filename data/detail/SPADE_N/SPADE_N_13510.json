Inhibited intestinal commensal Gram- B. thetaiotaomicron by 30% (1 uM). No effect on E-coli K12 and L-innocua (at 10 uM). Also angiogenic with RNase activity.Activity robustness: Antimicrobial activity was not influenced up to 50 mM NaCl, but compromised at higher concentrations of NaCl (75-150 mM) (Salt-sensitive)Structure: Structures of this small protein in complex with sulfate or phophate are also in the PDB.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.
