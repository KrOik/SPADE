            "Comments": "Thought to be orthologue of hBD-1. The native pBD-2 has NOT been purified yet, so it's unclear to what extent the synthetic peptide corresponds to the in vivo form. Also of note is that the synthetic peptide does not have S-S bonds. pBD-2 (4-8 microM) killed these pathogens within 3h. Antimicrobial activity of pBD-2 was decreased at higher ionic strengths with no residual activity at 150mM NaCl.",
