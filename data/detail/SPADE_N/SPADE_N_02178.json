            "Function": "Catalyzes an oxidative deamination of predominantly hydrophobic and aromatic L-amino acids, thus producing hydrogen peroxide that may contribute to the diverse toxic effects of this enzyme. Exhibits diverse biological activities, such as hemorrhage, hemolysis, edema, antibacterial and antiparasitic activities, as well as regulation of platelet aggregation. Its effect on platelets is controversial, since it either induces aggregation or inhibits agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions (By similarity).",
