            "Structure Description": "Crotamine contains an alpha-helix with residues 1-7 and a two-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet with residues 9-13 and 34-38 as the only regular secondary structures. These are connected with each other and the remainder of the polypeptide chain by the three disulfide bonds, which also form part of a central hydrophobic core (Ref.2).",

            "Half Life": "Mammalian:2.8 hourYeast:10 minE.coli:2 min",
            "Function": "It exhibits antimicrobial activities, hind limb paralysis, and severe muscle necrosis by a non-enzymatic mechanism. As a cell-penetrating peptide, crotamine has high specificity for actively proliferating cells, and interacts inside the cell with subcellular and subnuclear structures, like vesicular compartments, chromosomes and centrioles. Crotamine has marked activity against the eukaryotic pathogen Candida albicans at pH 7.5 or 5.5.",
            "Tissue specificity": "Expressed by the venom gland.",
            "Toxic Dose": "LD50 is 1.5 mg/kg by intravenous injection. LD50 is 32.8 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection into mice.(Ref.3)(Ref.4)",
            "Medical use": "Has high potential for use as an anticancer agent. In vivo treatment with this protein significantly delays tumor implantation, inhibits tumor growth and prolongs the lifespan of the mice with melanoma tumors. It has also potent and specific toxicity against tumor cell lines of aggressive mouse and human tumors, but low cytotoxicity against non-tumoral cell lines. In addition, this protein can act as a carrier capable of delivering DNA into replicating cells with low cytotoxicity against normal proliferative cells.(Ref.5)(Ref.6)",
            "Miscellaneous": "Has no hemolytic activity .",
