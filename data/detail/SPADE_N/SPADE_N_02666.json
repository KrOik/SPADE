In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"

            "Function": "Sapecins, which are potent bactericidal proteins, are produced in response to body injury. Thus, sapecin is probably a defense protein synthesized by Sarcophaga to prevent bacterial infection through the damaged body wall. This gene was also found to be activated in the embryonic and early pupal stages, suggesting that sapecin also plays a role in the ontogenetic processes of Sarcophaga.",
