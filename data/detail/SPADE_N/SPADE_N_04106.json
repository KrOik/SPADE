The peptide included in the antimicrobial agent includes 1 unit, 2 units or more units of sequence(s) or sequence(s) with partial modification, the sequence(s) composed of at least 6 contiguous amino acid residues selected from any one of amino acid sequences: (a) KVQIINKK; (b) SVQIVYKP; (c) QVEVKSEK; (d) KKVAVVRT; (e) KKVAIIRT; (f) KKPTSAK, and the total number of amino acid residues included in 1 unit, 2 units or more units of sequence(s) is 30% or more of the total number of amino acid residues constituting the peptide chain."
