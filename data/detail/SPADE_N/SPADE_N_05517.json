            "Structure Description": "This antibiotic with four thioether rings and a disulfide bond. The leader sequence shows highest (37%) similarity to the leader sequence of mersacidin.The N terminus of the corepeptide contains the conserved lipid II binding motif of class II lantibiotics (TxS/TxE/DC) and, interestingly, the C terminus of the core peptide contains two SWSC motifs. Such motifs also are found in the heterocycloanthracins.",
