                "Abstract": "The invention refers to small peptides with low hemolytic activity, presenting equal antiparasitic, antifungal and antibacterial activities. More specifically, it refers to a peptide called gomesin, with 18 amino acid residues, configured as a clamp-like structure consisting of two anti-parallel beta-folded sheets joined by a beta turn, containing four invariable residues of cystein forming two disulphide bridges, optionally configurable as a cyclic chain with closed edges."
