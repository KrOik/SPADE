In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"
