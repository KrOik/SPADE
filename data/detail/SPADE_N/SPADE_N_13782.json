            "Comments": "APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (50%) toTemporin-1Caor Temporin-1Cc (AP106), or Temporin-HB2 (AP2838), or Temporin-1Ce (AP108). F: 27%, K=L: 18%. GRAVY: 0.4; Mol Wt: 1327.63; Mol formula:C66H102N16O13; Mol Ex Coeff: 0;Activity: Active against foodborne bacteria Gram+ S. aureus ATCC25923 (MIC 32 ug/ml), L. monocytogenes KCTC3710 (MIC 32 ug/ml), B. subtilis KCTC 2217 (MIC 5.3 ug/ml), Gram- E. coli ATCC25922, S. typhimurium KCTC1926 (MIC 64 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC 5.3 ug/ml), and A. baumannii KCTC 2508 (MIC 5.3 ug/ml). These MIC values are the same as those obtained using purified PN5.SAR: C-terminal amidation slightly increased activity against S. aureus (MIC 16 ug/ml) and S. typhimurium (MIC 32 ug/ml). PN5 can inhibit numerous Clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli strains (MIC 2-16 ug/ml). It also inhibited biofilm formation of carbapenem-resistant E. coli and S. aureus (MBIC 8-16 ug/ml).Resistance development:no:bacteria:E. coli ATCC 25922: E. coli ATCC 25922 did not develop resistance to PN5 (treated at 0.5xMIC) after 25 passages while ceftazidime did.Toxicity: 5% hemolysis at 200 uM: not hemo.lytic. Less than 20% cytotoxicity in the RAW264.7 and HaCaT cell lines.Immune modulation: PN5 neutralizes LPS and inhibits the LPS- and LTA-induced production of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta  in RAW 264.7 cells.Structure: helical in 50% TFE or 30 mM SDS. It appears to be more helical in  lipoteichoic acid.Animal model:mouse:septic: mice were induced to be septic by treatment with E. coli LPS and D-galactosamine. Mice were killed in 18h due to septic shock. PN5 treatmetn (IP 1 or 5 mg/kg increased mice survival to 10% and 40%, respectively, at 48 h. It was found that TNF-alpha, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels significantly increased in LPS- and D-GalN-treated mice groups, and the increase aggravated the liver injury. Treatment reduced injury (Kang et al., 2022).",
