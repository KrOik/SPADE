The antiviral agent comprises an antiviral peptide, wherein the antiviral peptide has at least one unit of an amino acid sequence constituted by at least five contiguous amino acid residues (which is known as a nuclear localization sequence (NLS)) or an amino acid sequence having a partial modification in the NLS and also having at least one unit of an amino acid sequence constituted by at least five contiguous amino acid residues (which is known as a nuclear export sequence (NES)) or an amino acid sequence having a partial modification in the NES."
