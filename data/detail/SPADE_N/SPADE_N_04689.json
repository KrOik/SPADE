                "Abstract": "The present invention relates to an antifungal protein gene and cDNA sequence thereof, which is obtained by mining the whole genome sequences of Monascus pilosus BCRC 38072 and the unigene database. The gene can encode an antifungal protein MAFP1. A purified protein obtained from M. pilosus culture broth having molecular weight of about 7 kDa is identified as MAFP1 by N-terminal protein sequencing and comparative analysis. The purified MAFP1 protein can inhibit the growth of pathogens such as Paecilomyces variotii BCRC 33174 and Helminthosporium panici BCRC 35004. In addition, it is found by PCR test that the gene of this antifungal protein exists in other Monascus species such as M. Barkeri, M. floridanus, M. lunisporas, M. pilosus, M. ruber and the like. It is also been proved that the mafp1 gene and cDNA thereof in four Monascus strains, M. pilosus (BCRC 38072, BCRC 38093 and BCRC 31502) and M. ruber BCRC 31533, have the same DNA sequences."
