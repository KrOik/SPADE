            "Hemolytic Activity": "[Ref.31128493] Using human erythrocytes, the hemolytic activity of Skh-AMP1 at concentrations from 3.6 μM to 72 μM was reported in the range of 0.19%–2.1%. At the MIC concentration of 25.2 μM, a very low hemolytic activity of 0.67% (SD = 0.02) was observed. Also, this peptide at MFC concentrations (36, 54 and 72 μM) showed 0.98%, 1.45% and 2.1% hemolytic activity for human erythrocytes.",
            "Cytotoxicity": "[Ref.31128493] Skh-AMP1 has about 3.6% cytotoxicity at the concentration of 25.2 μM in 48 h. Therefore, this peptide had no significant cytotoxic effect at the concentrations of 12.6 and 25.2 μM at 6, 24, and 48 h. However, Skh-AMP1 has about 12% and 27% cytotoxicity at the concentration of 50.4 μM and 63 μM, respectively",
