            "Function": "Catalyzes an oxidative deamination of predominantly hydrophobic and aromatic L-amino acids, thus producing hydrogen peroxide that may contribute to the diverse toxic effects of this enzyme. Exhibits diverse biological activities, such as hemorrhage, hemolysis, edema, apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells or tumor cell lines, antibacterial and antiparasitic activities, as well as regulation of platelet aggregation. Effects of snake L-amino oxidases on platelets are controversial, since they either induce aggregation or inhibit agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions (By similarity).",
