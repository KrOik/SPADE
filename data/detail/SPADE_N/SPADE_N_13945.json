            "Comments": "Peptide discovery: Octominin II was obtained by deleting the last 5 charged amino acids of Octominin (AP03250).Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (78.26%) toOctomininA: 17%; I=L=N=K: 13%. GRAVY: 0.065; Mol W: 2522.967; Mol formula: C114H196N29O32; Mol Ex coeff: 5550.Activity: active against C. albicans (MIC 80 ug/ml), C. glabrata (MIC 55 ug/ml), and C.auris (MIC 160 ug/ml).Toxicity: murine RBC, HC50 > 100 ug/ml, ~10% hemo.lytic at 100 ug/ml. Little toxicity to RAW 264.7 cells till 200 ug/ml. However, it showed some toxicity to zebrafish larvae 72 hpf (50% survival after 96 h, n=10)Antivirulence:fungi: it suppressed numreous virulence factors related to drug resistance, genes for  the filamentation and hyphal growth, and secreted aspartic proteases;Animal model:Zebrafish: Octominin II decreased the virulence (less nutrophil infiltration) of C. albicans in vivo, which prevents further invasion of Candida.",
