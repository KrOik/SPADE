            "Comments": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals this sequence is most similar (63.64%) toSpa22P: 21%; R: 21%. a Pro-rich like peptide. Possibly a disulfide bond formation.  Mol. Wt: 1680.08; GRAVY: -0.56; Mol Formula:  C74H122N26O15S2; mol ex coeff: 0. Spampcin is likely an AMP with 153 amino acids (no activity is known). However, the fragment is active.Activity: active against Gram+ S.aureus (MIC >96 uM), L. monocytogenes (MIC 12-24 uM), E.faecalis (MIC >96 uM), E.faecium (MIC >96 uM), S.epidermidis (MIC >96 uM), Gram- P.aeruginosa (MIC >96 uM), E.coli (MIC >96 uM), A. baunmannii (MIC 48-96 uM), fungi C. neoformans (MFC 6-12 uM), F. graminearum (MFC 12-24 uM), F. solani (MFC 24-48 uM), A. niger (MFC 24-48 uM). Compared to Spa22, this further shortened peptide became even less active against numerous strains, indicating a longer peptide sequence is needed for antimicrobial potency. Jan2023",
