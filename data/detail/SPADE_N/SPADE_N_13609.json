            "Comments": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that the sequence of the peptide shows 27.5% similarity toCarnolysin.Discovery: Vatamin A deficiency increases the risk of skin infection. Why? Hooper and colleagues found that vitamin A can induce the expression of human resistin, which has antimicrobial effect. This deepens our understanding of the role of vitamins in skin innate immunity. Read thecommentary hereof this work.
