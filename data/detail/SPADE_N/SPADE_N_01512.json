Compositions and methods of using dermaseptin-type and piscidin-type antimicrobial peptides that demonstrate activity and improved therapeutic indices against microbial pathogens. The peptide compositions demonstrate the ability to not only maintain or improve antimicrobial activity against bacterial pathogens including Gram-negative microorganisms Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but also significantly decrease hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. Specificity determinants within the AMPS change selectivity from broad spectrum antimicrobial activity to AMPS with gram-negative selectivity."
