            "Function": "The impact of this protein on the neuronal activity of the honeybee brain is not known. It does not affect apparent movement or hatching of blowfly larvae. However, when injected into fish, it induces a strong reversible paralytic effect. In addition, the presence of this small peptide in the hemolymph of adult drones together with its induction after bacterial infection suggests that this peptide exhibits antibacterial activity. This peptide may act by inhibiting ion channelS.",
