            "Comments": "Non-cytotoxic antifungal agents. It was revealed that compounds 1 and 2 exhibited stronger antifungal activity than 3 and 4. Compounds 1 and 2 were structurally different from compounds 3 and 4 in terms of having less side chains in the fatty acid units, suggesting that the side chain length and the additional methyl group in the aliphatic chain are important for antifungal activity. These compounds also showed potent antimicrobial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria with MIC values of 0.04?0.08 uM.",
