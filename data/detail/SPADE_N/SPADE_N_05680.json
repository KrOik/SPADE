                "Abstract": "The present disclosure relates to an antimicrobial peptide analogue derived from abalone and an antimicrobial pharmaceutical composition containing the same. The antimicrobial peptide analogue according to the present disclosure is designed based on hdMolluscidin which is a peptide derived from the gill of abalone and has been designed to be commercially viable by reducing the number of amino acids. Despite the reduced number of amino acids, the designed peptide analogue exhibits very superior antimicrobial activity as well as high membrane permeability and low hemolytic activity."
