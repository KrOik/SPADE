                "Abstract": "The invention relates to a cyclo-chromo-valine-propyl-leucin-phenylpropyl peptide (Trp-Val-Val-Ala-Ile-Phe cyclic peptide) with hepatotoxicity and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity and a preparation method thereof, belonging to the technical field of extraction and preparation of biological products. The cyclo-tryptophan-valine-alanine-leucine-phenylalanine peptide is a pentadecane cyclic pentapeptide formed by connecting tryptophan, valine, alanine, leucine and phenylalanine by an amido bond. This is a novel compound and has not been reported in the literature. The compound of the invention can be obtained by culturing ranunculus japonicus and then extracting and separating. The pure product of the cyclo-valine-propyl-leucine-phenylpropanoid is white powder, and has half Inhibitory Concentration (IC) on hepatoma carcinoma cell HepG2 50 ) Comprises the following steps: 96.64 Î¼ g/mL, half inhibitory concentration of alpha-glucosidase (IC) 50 ) Comprises the following steps: 54.44. Mu.g/mL. The"
