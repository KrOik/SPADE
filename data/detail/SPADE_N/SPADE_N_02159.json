            "Function": "Catalyzes an oxidative deamination of predominantly hydrophobic and aromatic L-amino acids (L-Ile followed by L-Phe, L-Met, L-Val, L-Arg, L-Leu), thus producing hydrogen peroxide that may contribute to the diverse toxic effects of this enzyme. Exhibits diverse biological activities, such as hemorrhage (minimum hemorrhagic dose of 10 Âµg), and apoptosis. May also induce hemolysis, edema, antibacterial and antiparasitic activities. May also regulate platelet aggregation. Effects of snake L-amino oxidases on platelets are controversial, since they either induce aggregation or inhibit agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions.",
