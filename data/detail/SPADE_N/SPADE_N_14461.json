            "Comments": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is unique and shows only very low similarity (35.56%) toSPP-3K: 14%; L: 12%. GRAVY: -0.108; mol Wt: 8758.496; mol formula: C383H637N100O109; mol ex coeff: 7415. Predicted to be helical.Chemical modification:   Reduction of disulfide bonds and alkylation of cysteines indicate that disulfide bonds are important for peptide stability rather than activity.Activity: active against B. subtilis (MIC 1.25 uM), P. megaterium (MIC 0.039 uM), S-aureus (MIC >10 uM), E. coli (MIC 1.25 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 10 uM), K. pneumoniaea (MIC 1.25 uM), V. anguillarum (MIC 0.625 uM). MBC values are the same: bactericidal.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli SHufle T7 Express lysY: Vector: MAL-C5X (NEB); carrier: maltose-binding protein (MBP); expression induction: ITPG; purification: the fusion protein MBP-Intein-rDaNKlA soluble fraction binding to amylose affinity resin and eluted with 10 mM maltose; cleavage: splicing reaction of the intein at an acidic pH or increased temp. Note that the recombinant peptide (rDaNKlA) contains two extra glycines (GG) at the N-terminus.",
