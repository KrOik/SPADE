Has antipromoter activity, prevents promotion by tetradecanoyl phorbal acetate (TPA) in JB6 cells. Prevents tertiary butyl hydroperoxide-induced mutagenesis. Protects AT base pairs and shows antimutagenesis activity in TA102 and TA104 S.typhimurium mutagenesis tests. Inhibits paw edema formation induced by phospholipase A2 in Swiss Wistar mice. Prevents the release of arachidonate, the parent compound for the synthesis of prostaglandins and prostacyclins. Has antimalarial activity, kills P. falciparum. Has antivenom activity, nullifies the lethal effects of N.naja venom and inhibits phospholipase A2 present in N.naja venom. Has antifungal activity, inhibits cilia formation by A.niger. Is not toxic or allergenic.",
