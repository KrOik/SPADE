            "Comments": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of this peptide shows 34.9% similarity tobacterial Acidocin A.  Notably, LcnB can be cleaved by its own proteinase PrtP with an unknown reason. A fragment with the first six amino acid missing was chartacterized and found to be unable to bind to the receptor to inhibit man-PTS sugar uptake. However, the parent peptide was active against L. lactis subsp. lactis BGMN1-501 (Vukotic et al., 2019). Strains carrying the genetic information for the immunity protein against LcnB were not affected by LcnB (Venema et al., 1993). Temporin 1AUa, with no activity at >80 uM against Gram+ bacteria, has been replaced.",
