Many factors can strongly affect the efficacy of antifungal peptides. For example, disulfide bonds can help to increase potency of the oxidized form of NCR044. For deployment of NCR044 in crop protection, one could envisage further manipulating the cationicity/hydrophobicity of the oxidized or reduced NCR044 through site-directed mutagenesis and increase its antifungal potency on the surface of plant tissues without causing phytotoxicity.",
