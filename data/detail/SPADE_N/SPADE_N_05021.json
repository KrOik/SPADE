                "Abstract": "The present invention relates to FMRF amide type peptides and their non-amidated precursors, to recombinant nucleic acids encoding for such peptides, to the use of these nucleic acids, in forms substantially isolated from other nucleic acid or when incorporated into vectors, to transform organisms in order to render them capable of producing these peptides, to the use of such peptides, nucleic acid and vectors as pesticidal agents, eg. insecticidal, acaricidal and helminthecidal agents and to compositions comprising one or more of these. A peptide or salt thereof comprising an amino acid sequence Pro-Pro-(Xaa1)n-Phe-Xaa2-Arg-Xaa3 or a conservatively substituted analogue thereof, wherein the N terminal of said peptide may be free amino or protected amino and the C-terminal of said peptide, which is the C-terminal -Xaa3 of the above sequence, may consist of that residue with a free carboxylic acid group or with an amidated carboxyl of the formula CONR1R2 wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected"
