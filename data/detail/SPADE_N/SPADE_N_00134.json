            "Function": "Thuricin CD is produced by Bacillus thuringiensis DPC 6431, a bacterial strain isolated from a human fecal sample, and it consists of two distinct peptides, Trn-alpha and Trn-beta, that act synergistically to kill a wide range of clinical C. difficile isolates. Thuricin CD showes no activity against any Gram-negative organisms tested, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., Salmonella sp., and Bacteroides fragilis.",
            "Biophysicochemical properties": "Cell-free supernatants of thuricin were active throughout the pH range of 2-9 and heat stable up to 85 °C. There was, however, a reduction in activity at 90 °C and a complete loss of activity at 100 °C after 15 min.",
