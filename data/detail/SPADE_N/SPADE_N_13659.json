Spot on lawn active against also B. mallei Old ISU and B. mallei NVSL 86-567â€“562. Also active against B. cenocepacia AU0756 (MIC 0.25-0.5 uM) and B. cenocepacia AU24326 (MIC 2 uM) (Ref see SAR).MOA:  Ubonodin inhibits E. coli RNA polymerase (RNAP).Expression: PupB is identified as the ubonodin outer membrane (OM) receptor (Do et al., 2022).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.SAR: a library of over 90 000 ubonodin variants with amino acid substitutions was expressed in Escherichia coli. One variant H17G was found to have improved activity (MIC 0.125-0.25 uM) against a clinical isolate of the Bcc member B. cenocepacia (Thokkadam et al., 2023).Reg. 2/2020; updated 7/2022; 3/2023",
