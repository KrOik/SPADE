            "Comments": "Catalyzes an oxidative deamination of predominantly hydrophobic and aromatic L-amino acids, thus producing hydrogen peroxide that may contribute to the diverse toxic effects of this enzyme. Effects of snake L-amino oxidases on platelets are controversial, since they either induce aggregation or inhibit agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions. This protein may also induce hemorrhage, hemolysis, and edema. Also has parasiticidal activities against leishmania, as a result of enzyme-catalyzed hydrogen peroxide production, and the 50% inhibitory concentration was estimated in 2.39 microg/ml.",
