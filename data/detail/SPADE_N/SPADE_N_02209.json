                "Abstract": "The invention concerns antimicrobial peptides obtained from penaeid prawns having the following characteristics: a molecular mass of about 5 to 7 kDa; a pHi not less than 9; an N-terminal portion comprising a region (A) of about 15 to 25 amino acids rich in proline; and a C-terminal portion comprising a region (B) of about 20 to 30 amino acids and containing 6 cysteine residues forming three intramolecular disulfide bonds. The invention also concerns the nucleic acid sequences coding for said peptides and enabling their production by genetic engineering."
