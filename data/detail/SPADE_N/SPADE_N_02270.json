The peptides are nonhemolytic, and exhibit minimal in vitro cytotoxicity. A pharmaceutical composition comprising retrocyclin as an active agent is administered therapeutically to a patient suffering from a bacterial and/or viral infection, or to an individual facing exposure to a bacterial and/or viral infection, especially one caused by the HIV-1 retrovirus or other sexually-transmitted pathogens."
