            "Function": "Catalyzes the oxidative deamination of positively charged L-amino acids L-Lys and L-Arg but not of amino acids L-His, L-Asp or L-Glu. Has antibacterial activity. This antibacterial activity is bacteriostatic in the absence of amino acids L-Lys or L-Arg but bactericidal in their presence. The antibacterial effect is largely dependent on H2O2 produced in the oxidative deamination of substrates. Has hemagglutinating activity towards rabbit erythrocytes. Hemagglutinating activity is inhibited by the glycoprotein fetuin, but not by glucose, mannose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine or sialic acid.",

Inactive at pH 2); Temperature dependence (Activity remains stable after 30 min at 55 degrees Celsius).",
