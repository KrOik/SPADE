Plantarum JY22 was purified from Cell free supernatant (CFS) by ethyl acetate and gel filtration. Antimicrobial robustness: activity is heat-stable (autocalve); pH-sensitive: activity gradually decreased till pH 5.5 (74.2%) and lost at pH 6.5 or higher. Protease-susceptible (nutrase, pepsin, papain) but not alpha-amylase. The original Phylloseptin-H10 has been merged with AP1350.",
