                "Abstract": "The invention relates to a cyclo-c-v-l-Leu peptide (Trp-Ala-Val-Leu-Leu cyclic peptide) with hepatotoxicity and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity and a preparation method thereof, belonging to biological productsThe technical field of extraction and preparation. The cyclo-tryptophan-alanine-valine-leucine peptide is a pentadecatomic cyclic pentapeptide which is formed by connecting tryptophan, alanine, valine, leucine and leucine through an amide bond. This is a novel compound and has not been reported in the literature. The compound of the invention can be obtained by culturing ranunculus japonicus and then extracting and separating. The pure cyclochrome-C-valine-bright peptide is white powder, and has half Inhibitory Concentration (IC) on liver cancer cell HepG2 50 ) Comprises the following steps: 91.15 Î¼ g/mL, half inhibitory concentration of alpha-glucosidase (IC) 50 ) Comprises the following steps: 50.09. Mu.g/mL. The compound can be used as a potential drug for treating liver cancer and"
