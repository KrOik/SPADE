            "Comments": "Discovery: initially discovered as a protease inhibitor (Macedo et al., 2007). Subsequently, it was found to have insecticidal activity (Ramos et al., 2012) and antimicrobial activity in 2016 (see ref).Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is poorly similar (27.41%) toinsect AMP17GRAVY: -0.26; mol Wt: 19636.217; mol formula: C876H1379N234O262S4; mol ex coeff: 25715. ILTI displayed major differences to most other Kunitz inhibitors in that it contained only one disulfide bridge, and did not have two polypeptide chains as for the majority of other Kunitz inhibitors purified from Mimosoideae speciesActivity: ILTI strongly inhibited in particular the growth of C. tropicalis and C. buinensis, inducing cellular agglomeration.anti-insect activity against Diatraea saccharalis and Heliothis virescens larvae.Protease inhibitor: ILTI inhibited bovine trypsin with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K(i)) of 6 x 10(-9)M, but did not inhibit chymotrypsin, papain and alpha-amylase.MOA:fungi:C. tropicalis: MOA:fungi:C. buinensis: it permeabilized fungal membranes, induced the production of ROS. Could enter cells.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: pET vector/IPTI induced and expressed as SUMO-fusion protein, recombinant form reILTI. reg.2/2024",
