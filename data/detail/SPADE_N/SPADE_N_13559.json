            "Comments": "APD analysis reveals that the sequence of THE PEPTIDE shows poor similarity to (17.4%)mCCL28. Activity for intact peptide has not been tested. Two peptides from the core region were made: Lc-NK-lysin-1 (GLLKSLCKKFVKGHLGELIEELTTSDD) and Lc-NK-lysin-2 (VCNEIGLLKSLCKKFVKGHLGE). Lc-NK-lysin-1  is active against  Gram+ S. aureus (MIC 12-24 uM), B. subtilis (MIC 24-48 uM), Gram- E. coli and V. harveyi (MIC 12-24 uM). Lc-NK-lysin-2 is active against Gram+ S. aureus (MIC 12-24 uM) and Gram- E. coli (MIC 24-48 uM). Updated 8/2020; 7/2021",
