No antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, P. vulgaris, S. sonnei and S. typhosa. No antifungal activity against C. albicans.",
            "Caution": "The isopeptide linked residue 9 is shown as Asn rather than Asp as mentioned in Ref.1, because it is not known whether Asp or Asn is encoded and the isopeptide bonds are almost always formed between the amides Asn or Gln and N6-lysine or alpha amino groups, with the liberation of an ammonia that makes the reaction essentially irreversible.",
