            "Function": "Main toxin of bee venom with strong hemolytic activity. Integrates into cell membranes and has multiple effects, probably, as a result of its interaction with negatively charged phospholipids. It inhibits well known transport pumps such as the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase. Increases the permeability of cell membranes to ions, particularly Na(+) and indirectly Ca(2+), because of the Na(+)-Ca(2+)-exchange.",
