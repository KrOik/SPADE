                "Abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), small compounds that often exhibitbroad spectrum antimicrobial activity, are garnering interest as potential therapeutics against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. Development of new AMPs is arduous due to the practical limitations of classical protein-based discovery approaches. A high throughput bioinformatics approach is described which is able to confirm identification of known AMPs from the North American bullfrog ( Rana ( Lithobates ) catesbeiana ) genome, and a bioinformatics approach is used to develop new AMPs. The described AMPs exhibit antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis via microtitre broth dilution assays, indicating broader efficacy."
