                "Abstract": "The present invention provides an isolated protein obtainable from a plant source which has anti-Phytophthora activity and a molecular weight of about 60Â±5 kDa as judged by SDS PAGE-electrophoresis, an isolated DNA sequence comprising an open reading frame capable of encoding a protein according to the invention, preferably characterized in that it comprises an open reading frame which is capable of encoding a protein as represented by amino acids 1 to 540 of SEQ ID NO: 6, or the precursor of said protein, and DNA capable of hybridising therewith under stringent conditions. The invention further comprises plants incorporating chimeric DNA capable of encoding a protein according to the invention, and wherein the protein is expressed. Also methods are provided for combatting fungi, especially Phytophthora infestans , using a protein or a host cell capable of producing the protein."
