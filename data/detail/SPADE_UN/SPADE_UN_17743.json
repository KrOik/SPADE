                "Patent Title": "Preparation and application of anti-tumor polypeptide coupling medicine",
                "Abstract": "The invention discloses an anti-tumor polypeptide conjugate drug and application thereof. The molecular sequence of the polypeptide coupled drug is as follows: MTX-Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly-Gly-Ile-Gly-Ala-Val-Leu-Lys-Val-Leu-Thr-Thr-Gly-Leu-Pro-Ala-Leu-Ile-Ser-Trp-Ile-Lys-Arg-Lys-Arg-Gln-Gln-NH 2 Wherein the Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly sequence linked to MTX is cleaved by cathepsin-B or the like. The antitumor polypeptide provided by the invention has membrane penetrability, and can be used as a carrier of a small-molecule antitumor drug to prepare a polypeptide coupled drug, so that the antitumor drug can be promoted to penetrate a cell membrane of a tumor cell, the release of the small-molecule drug is completed, and the tumor treatment is carried out."
