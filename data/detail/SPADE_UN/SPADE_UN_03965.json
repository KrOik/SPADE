                "Abstract": "A method is described for treating a microbial infection with a peptide whose amino acid sequence has a formula selected from the group consisting of: (a) Bn1-Z; (b) Bn1-Z-Bn2; and (c) Z-Bn1 wherein B is a basic amino acid residue; n1 and n2 are 1 to 6; and Z is a sequence of about 11 to about 24 amino acid residues, the sequence having an average hydrophobicity value of at least 0.3, and preferably at least 0.4. These peptides show antimicrobial activity against microorganisms including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria."
