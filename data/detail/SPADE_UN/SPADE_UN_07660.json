                "Abstract": "The present invention relates to several types of antimicrobial peptides including reverse antimicrobial peptides, antimicrobial oligopeptides and other antimicrobial compositions, such as cecropin P1. The present invention also relates to the use of these antimicrobial peptides to provide organisms, and, in particular, plants, with protection from microbial pathogens. Finally, the present invention relates to a screening method which may be useful for determining the phytotoxity of an antimicrobial peptide."
