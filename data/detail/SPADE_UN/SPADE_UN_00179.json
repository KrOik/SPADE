            "Function": "Catalyzes an oxidative deamination of predominantly hydrophobic and aromatic L-amino acids (high activity against L-Met, L-Leu, L-Nle, L-Trp, L-Phe and moderate activity against L-Tyr), thus producing hydrogen peroxide that may contribute to the diverse toxic effects of this enzyme. Exhibits diverse biological activities, such as hemorrhage, hemolysis, edema, antibacterial and antiparasitic activities (By similarity). In addition, this protein induces apoptosis. It also interacts with endothelial cells, and inhibits collagen- and ADP-induced platelet aggregation. L-LAAO family effects on platelets are controversial, since it either induces aggregation or inhibits agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions.",
