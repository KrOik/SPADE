                "Abstract": "The invention concerns novel antimicrobial peptides of the family of defensins, in particular antifungal, called termicines, polynucleotides encoding said peptides, vectors containing them for transforming a host organism and the method for transforming said organism. The invention also concerns transformed organisms, in particular yeast producing termicine, or plant cells and plants, the termicines produced by the transformed plats providing them with resistence to fungus-mediated diseases. The invention further concerns the use of termicines as medicine and pharmaceutical compositions containing them."
