                "Abstract": "This disclosure is directed to compositions comprised of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) having an alpha helical structure wherein one side is highly hydrophobic. Representative sequences of the antimicrobial peptides include ILKKWWββαβGLLGβLLGαVββVIKβLββI (SEQ ID No. 2), LKKWWKβαKGLLGGLLGKVββVIK (SEQ ID No. 12), and αKKααKKαKGαLGGLαGK (SEQ ID No. 18). Additional embodiments disclose methods for treating a microbial infection; reducing biofilm; decreasing inflammation; and treating infectious diseases, COPD, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, rhinosinusitis, septicemia, RSV, TB or cancer; in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic amount of an antimicrobial peptide."
