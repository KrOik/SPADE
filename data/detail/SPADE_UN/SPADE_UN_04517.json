                "Abstract": "The present invention relates to a gene construct which is capable of achieving efficient production of an antimicrobial peptide in a microorganism, and a method for efficient mass production and separation of an antimicrobial peptide using the same. The gene construct of the present invention has a translationally coupled configuration of two independent and separate cistrons which encode an acidic peptide and a basic antimicrobial peptide, each having an opposite charge, under the control of a single promoter. The translationally coupled acidic peptide and basic antimicrobial peptide undergo charge-charge interaction simultaneously with expression thereof to neutralize the potential cytotoxicity of the antimicrobial peptide, resulting in prevention of antimicrobial peptide-mediated killing of host microorganisms. In addition, a conjugate of the acidic peptide and the antimicrobial peptide can be separated without chemical or enzymatic treatment. Therefore, it is possible to achieve easy mass pro"
