                "Abstract": "The present invention relates to an alpha-helical peptide having antimicrobial activity against drug-resistant bacteria and an antimicrobial composition containing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to an alpha-helical peptide having an antifungal activity, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 synthesized in an amphipathic structure existing on the surface having different hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity by using as a hydrophobic amino acid a novel antimicrobial active peptide , Lysine and arginine as the cationic amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 19, isoleucine and tryptophan as hydrophobic amino acids, and glutamic acid as an anionic amino acid, and a new antibacterial composition synthesized with an amphipathic structure having hydrophilic and hydrophobic faces Active peptides and the compounds containing them It relates to compositions for. Since the antimicrobial active peptide of the present invention has no cytotoxicity and exhibits excellent antimicrobial activity, it can be effec"
