                "Abstract": "Antimicrobial peptide provided by present invention is an artificially designed antimicrobial peptide that does not occur naturally, and includes a sequence composed of at least 6 contiguous amino acid residues selected from an amino acid sequence constituting laminin binding site (LBS), or said sequence with one or a plurality of amino acid residue(s) conservatively replaced, and an amino acid sequence that can express antimicrobial activity against at least one kind of bacteria or fungi. It is desirable that the total number of amino acid residues is 100 or less."
