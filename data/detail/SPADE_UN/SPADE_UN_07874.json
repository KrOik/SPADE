                "Abstract": "New antimicrobial truncated peptides are disclosed which are based upon a known peptide, PR-39 (SEQ ID NO: 1) but which contain a lesser number of amino acid residues yet still retain antimicrobial activity. The most preferred peptide compound is PR-26, SEQ ID NO: 2. The invention also relates to a method of inhibiting microbial growth by administering an effective amount of a peptide in accordance with the invention."
