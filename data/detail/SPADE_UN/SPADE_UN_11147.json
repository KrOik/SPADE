                "Abstract": "A protein having a polypeptide subunit containing an N-terminal amino acid sequence of Ser-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ala-Leu-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro-Leu-Ala-His-Val-Val-Ala-Asn-Pro-Gln-Val-Glu-Gly-Gln-Leu-Gln-Trp-Leu. The protein of the present invention is obtained in substantially pure form at high activity recovery, and is excellent in inducing necrosis of tumors with no toxicity upon the normal tissues of the living body. The protein of the present invention is thermally stable and, therefore, when preparation of pharmaceutical compositions is conducted, the protein of the present invention can be stably formulated into compositions."
