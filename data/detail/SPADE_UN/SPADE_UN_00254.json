            "Function": "Catalyzes an oxidative deamination of predominantly hydrophobic and aromatic L-amino acids, thus producing hydrogen peroxide that may contribute to the diverse toxic effects of this enzyme. Exhibits diverse biological activities, such as hemorrhage, hemolysis, edema, apoptosis, and antiparasitic activities By similarity. This protein has antibacterial activity abd cytotoxic activity, as well as an ability to induce platelet aggregation. Effects of snake L-amino oxidases on platelets are controversial, since they either induce aggregation or inhibit agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions.",
