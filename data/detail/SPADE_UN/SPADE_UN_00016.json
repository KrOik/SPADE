            "Comments": "Discovered by genome mining based on the known MccJ25-gene coding cluster McjABCD. Capistruin is endoded by the capABCD gene cluster, where capA encodes the precursor polypeptide, capB cleaves the presursor and is likely to promote the cyclization, capC encodes an enzyme that activates the side chain of Asp9 for cyclization, and capD encodes a immunity protein. Showed activity against closely related Burkholderia and Pseudomonas strains. Different from the lasso structure of MccJ25, where the N-terminal Gly forms an amide bond with the carboxyl group of Glu8, capistruin forms a 9-residue macrolactam ring formed between NH of Gly1 and the carboxylic side chain of Asp9. In addition, Arg15 is reponsible for the trapping of the tail in the ring structure.",
