                "Abstract": "The invention relates to peptides for use as antiviral agent, consisting of an amino acid chain which contains a domain of 10 to 25 amino acids, wherein the majority of the amino acids of the one half of the domain are positively charged amino acids and the majority of the amino acids of the other half of the domain are uncharged amino acids. The invention further relates to oligomers of these peptides consisting of at least two such peptides which are coupled to each other, optionally via a spacer, for use as antiviral agent, in addition to the use of the peptides and/or oligomers for the manufacture of a medicine for treating viral infections."
