                "Abstract": "The invention provides a polypeptide targeting CD47 and application thereof. The polypeptide of the invention can specifically recognize and bind to CD47 protein. The invention also provides the polypeptide, a bivalent body, a multivalent body and a polypeptide conjugate formed by the polypeptide, and application of the polypeptide in preparing a diagnosis and treatment agent and an imaging agent for targeting and killing tumor cells. The polypeptide is synthesized by a chemical method, is simple to prepare, strong in specificity, high in selectivity, safe and reliable, overcomes the defects of long production cycle of an antibody biological preparation and the like, and can be used for preparing a cancer-targeted probe. The invention can carry out immune blocking on the CD47 protein by an immunotherapy method, thereby activating the recognition and phagocytosis of an in-vivo immune system on tumor cells, effectively inhibiting the growth and the metastasis of tumors and realizing good anti-tumor"
