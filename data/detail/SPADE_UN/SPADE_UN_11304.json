                "Abstract": "The invention relates to antibacterial and antimalarial peptides which are hybrids peptides which a of naturally occurring peptides such as cecropins, attacins, magainins, sarcotoxin, sapecin, bactenecins, alamethidicins, defensins and PGLa, and toxins such as streptolysins, melittin, barbatolysin, paradaxins and delta hemolysin. The hybrid peptides of the present invention are easily synthesized and have reduced toxicity. Also included in the invention are pharmaceutical compositions containing such hybrid peptides, and methods of treating patients infected with an organism against which these peptides are active."
