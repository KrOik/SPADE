            "Comments": "Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (60%) toLK2W: 40%; K: 40%.Activity: active against S. aureus ATCC 25923 or 5 clinical and resistant MRSA strains (MIC 8 uM), B. subtilis ATCC 23857 (MIC 2 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (MIC 4 uM), E. coli ATCC 25922 or resistant strains 850 or 780 (MIC 8 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 or resistant strains 124 or 6434N (MIC 4-8 uM), A. baumannii ATCC 19606 or resistant strains 5444 or 92359 (MIC 8-16 uM).  It inhibited formation of biofilms:bacteria:S. aureus; biofilms:bacteria:P. aeruginosa.Antimicrobial robustness: NaCl-insensitive:S. aureus; MgCl2-insensitive:S. aureus; KCl-insensitive:S. aureus; ZnCl2-insensitive:S. aureus; FeCl3-insensitive:S. aureus; NH4Cl-insensitive:S. aureus; CaCl2-insensitive:S. aureus;  NaCl-insensitive:K. pneumoniae; MgCl2-insensitive:K. pneumoniae; KCl-insensitive:K. pneumoniae; ZnCl2-insensitive:K. pneumoniae; FeCl3-insensitive:K. pneumoniae; NH4Cl-insensitive:K. pneumoniae; CaCl2-insensitive:K. pneumoniae.Synergy:antibiotics:    WK2 worked synergistically with polymyxin B or cephalothin against K. pneumoniae .  It also displayed synergy with polymyxin B, cephalothin, and streptomycin against S. aureus.MOA:bacteria:K. pneumoniae:  MOA:bacteria:S. aureus:  permeated and depolarized bacterial membranes.Structure:  random coil in water and helical in 50% TFE. Helicity is length-dependent and longer peptides are more helical in the series.Resistance development:no:bacteria:S. aureus: S. aureus or Resistance development:no:bacteria:K. pneumoniae did not develop resistance in a sub-MIC multiple passage experiment to WK2 or polymyxin B. Cf.: cephalothin MIC increased by 8 fold after only 8 passages.In vitro toxicity: hRBC: HC10 227.45 uM. HC50 >256 uM. not hemo.lytic. LC50 55.81 uM to human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293T).In vivo toxicity: IP injection BALB/c  mice: LD50 78.99 mg/kg (Cf.: polymyxin B: LD50 23.55 mg/kg). Combined with histological analysis, WK2 has a better safety profile than polymyxin B.Animal model:mouse: Mouse serum half time: t1/2 3.63 h (Cf: polymyxin B: 11.17 h).  (1) lung infection: infected with K. pneumoniae, ~1 log CFU decrease observed after 5 treatments each at 5 mg/kg within 2 days compared to the untreated control. (2) wound healing model: infectes with 1power7 S. aureus. Treatment at 10 ul (2 mg/kg) at 6, 12, 24, 30, and 36 h. 6 log CFU drop was observed in the treated wound compared to the untreated wound.",
