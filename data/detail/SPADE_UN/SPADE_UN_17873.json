                "Abstract": "The invention belongs to the fields of biochemistry, molecular biology and neuroscience, and relates to a novel alpha O-conotoxin GeXIVA mutant, a pharmaceutical composition and application thereof. Specifically, the invention relates to an isolated polypeptide, the amino acid sequence of which is that one or more amino acids in a mother sequence are removed, or one or more amino acids in the mother sequence are replaced by L-type amino acids or D-type amino acids with the same number, wherein the mother sequence is SEQ ID NO. 1, SEQ ID NO. 62 or SEQ ID NO. 63; and the polypeptide has activity of blocking alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChR. The polypeptide can specifically block alpha 9 alpha 10nAChR, and has good application prospect in the aspects of preparing analgesic drugs, drugs for treating mental diseases and cancers, neuroscience tool drugs and the like."
