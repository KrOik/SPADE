                "Abstract": "An object of the present invention is to provide antibacterial peptides of high safety, improved antibacterial activity, wide antibacterial spectrum and lower molecular weight, and antibacterial agents containing such peptides as an effective ingredient, whose effects on in vivo immune system is decreased because of lower molecular weight thereof when they are given. To achieve this object, there are provided antibacterial peptides represented by the following formula: X-Ala-Ile-Arg-Lys-Arg-NH 2 â€ƒâ€ƒ( 1 ) wherein X is a peptide in which one or more than two amino acid residues are linked by peptide linkage, and Arg-NH 2 means that a carboxyl group of Arg is amidated."
