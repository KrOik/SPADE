                "Abstract": "Methods of covalently-stabilizing alpha-helical, chimeric peptides constrained within a homotrimeric or heterotrimeric coiled-coil structure are disclosed. The coiled-coil structures made by the methods disclosed within this specification mimic all or a portion of the internal, trimeric coiled-coil motif contained within the fusogenic conformation of an enveloped virus membrane-fusion protein, particularly the internal coiled-coil domain of the HIV gp41 ectodomain. The HIV-derived, chimeric peptides disclosed comprise a non-HIV, soluble, trimeric form of a coiled-coil fused in helical phase to all or a portion of the N-helix of HIV gp41 and are covalently-stabilized in a homotrimeric or heterotrimeric coiled-coil structure through the formation of disulfide or chemoselective bonds between said peptides. The covalently-stabilized, HIV-derived, homotrimeric or heterotrimeric coiled-coil structures made by the methods disclosed herein represent a close mimetic of a HIV gp41 fusion intermediate and ar"
