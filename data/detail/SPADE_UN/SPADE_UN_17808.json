                "Abstract": "An anticancer agent is provided comprising a tumor targeting peptide having or having been modified to present two cysteine residues with an arsenic atom between them such that the tumor targeting peptide is cyclized to produce an arsenic-containing anticancer agent. This allows selection of appropriate tumor targeting peptides for treatment of a given cancer, whereby subsequent agents provide more targeted delivery of arsenic to the tumor microenvironment."
