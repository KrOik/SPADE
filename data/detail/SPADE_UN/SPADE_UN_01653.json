                "Patent Title": "Medical Devices and Coatings with Non-Leaching Antimicrobial Peptides.",
                "Abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides enable an alternate approach to developing antimicrobial coatings due to their targeting of the membranes of the bacteria. High specific activity is achieved by orienting the peptides so that the antimicrobial ends of the peptides maximally contact the bacteria. In one embodiment, one end of the peptide is covalently attached directly to the substrate. In another embodiment, the peptides are immobilized on the substrate using a coupling agent or tether. Non-covalent methods include coating the peptide onto the substrate or physiochemically immobilizing the peptides on the substrate using highly specific interactions, such as the biotin/avidin or streptavidin system. The compositions are substantially non-leaching, antifouling, and non-hemolytic. The immobilized peptides retain sufficient flexibility and mobility to interact with and de endocytosed by the bacteria, viruses, and/or fungi upon exposure. Immobilizing the peptides to the substrate reduces concerns regarding toxic"
