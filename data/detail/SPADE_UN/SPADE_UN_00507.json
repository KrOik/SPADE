                "Abstract": "The present invention relates to families of polypeptides and lipopolypeptides that have antimicrobial and endotoxin-neutralizing activities. These molecules show a broad spectrum of activity against various pathogens (including bacteria, viruses, fungi etc.) These compounds can be used alone or in combination therapy with conventional antibiotics or antiendotoxic agents. In addition, the present invention discloses processes for making and using of the compounds."
