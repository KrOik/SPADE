            "Comments": "Activity: Likely kills S. aureus and E. coli. Active against metabolically active fungi A. fumigatus and C. albicans but not metabolically quiescent forms. Antifungal activity is localized to the N-terminal region (Tomee JF et al., 1997)). It seems that the N-terminal domain is responsible for antimicrobial activity. It also inhibits neutrophil elastase and other enzymes via its C-terminal domain, especially Leu72-Met73 residues. It also inhibts HIV-1 and HIV-2. It may constitute a major shield from HIV infection orally (Stergios Doumas et al., 2005).MOA: SLPI proved to be a potent inhibitor of translation of E. coli in vitro.Structure: Crystal structure of SLPI was solved [Gr√ºtter, Fendrich, Huber & Bode (1988), EMBO J. 7, 345-351] as two whey acidic protein (WAP) domains, each containing 8 Cys. While the N-terminal domain is responsible for membrane lysis, the C-terminal domain is designed for inhibition.",
