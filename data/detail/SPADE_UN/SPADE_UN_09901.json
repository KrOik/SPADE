                "Patent Title": "M-protein peptides of influenza virus as antiviral agents.",
                "Abstract": "Peptides substantially corresponding to the 148-162 region of type A influenza M protein and additionally containing at least one amino acid in the 163-166 region are disclosed to have high activity as influenza transcription inhibitors and thus as antiviral agents against influenza virus and other RNA viruses. The modification of these peptides by incorporation into liposomes or by addition of long-chain alkylamino acids is also shown as in the use of all such materials in antiviral drug formulations."
