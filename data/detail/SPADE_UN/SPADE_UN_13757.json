                "Abstract": "An antimicrobial peptide and an antimicrobial peptide composition comprising the same are provided. The antimicrobial peptide and the antimicrobial peptide composition have remarkably high antibacterial activity against gram-positive (+) and gram-negative (âˆ’) bacteria, compared to wild-type LPcin-I having an antimicrobial ability, which consists of a sequence of 31 amino acids. Also, the antimicrobial peptide can be useful in being easily synthesized and saving production costs since the antimicrobial peptide has a smaller number of amino acids, compared to the wild-type LPcin-I."
