                "Abstract": "We evaluated the antibacterial activity of synthetic short proline-rich lipopeptides (SPRLPs) against clinically-relevant Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. The short peptide sequence of SPRLPs were inspired by the repeating PXP motif apparent in longer PRAMPs. We assessed the potential of these SPRLPs to serve as adjuvants in combination with clinically-used antibiotics against P. aeruginosa. Our results revealed an amphiphilic non-hemolytic non-cytotoxic L-lipopeptide lead sequence that strongly potentiates minocycline and rifampicin against MDR/XDR P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, the adjuvant potency is retained in its enantiomeric D-SPRLP counterpart."
