                "Patent Title": "Synergistic antifungal protein and compositions containing same.",
                "Abstract": "Novel plant proteins (SAFPs) which synergize the activity of antifungal antibiotics are identified. SAFPs are demonstrated to synergize antifungal antibiotics, such as nikkomycins, polyoxins and amphotericins. SAFPs alone also display antifungal activity against several species of fungi, including strains of Candida, Trichoderma, Neurospora and strains of the plant pathogens Fusarium, Rhizoctonia and Chaetomium. Synergistic antifungal compositions containing SAFP and antifungal antibiotics are provided. In particular, synergistic compositions of corn-SAFP (zeamatin), sorghum-SAFP (sormatin) or oat-SAFP (avematin) and nikkomycin are found to be effective as antifungal compositions, especially against the opportunistic human pathogen Candida albicans. Method for employing SAFPs and synergistic compositions containing them for the inhibition of fungi are provided. In addition, a method for purifying SAFP from grain meal is provided."
