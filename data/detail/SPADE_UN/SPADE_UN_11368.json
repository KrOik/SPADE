            "Structure Description": "Active plantaricin A is composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain. The sequence of alpha chain and beta chain, however, are essential identical with the only difference being one additional Ala at the N-terminus of chain b. The 3D structure of chain a in DPC micelles has been determined by NMR spectroscopy (J Biol Chem. 2005 Jun 17;280(24):22945-50). The helical region (residues 12-21) are good for membrane targeting as well as the ph",
