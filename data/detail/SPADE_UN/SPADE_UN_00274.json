                "Abstract": "Novispirin peptides are antimicrobial agents with potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The peptides are nonhemolytic, exhibit reduced in vitro cytotoxicity relative to other antimicrobial peptides, and were well-tolerated in vivo after intravenous injection. Novispirins also bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a property that may mitigate symptoms associated with Gram-negative bacterial infection. A pharmaceutical composition comprising novispirin as an active agent is administered to a patient suffering from or predisposed to a microbial infection, particularly Gram-negative bacterial infections."
