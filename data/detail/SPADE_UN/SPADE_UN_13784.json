                "Patent Title": "Novel antimicrobial peptide derived from Hp1404 peptide and uses thereof",
                "Abstract": "The present invention relates to an antimicrobial peptide in which i) first and fourteenth amino acids are deleted, ii) fourth and eighth amino acids are substituted with lysine (K), iii) seventh amino acid is substituted with leucine (L), iv) ninth amino acid is glycine (G) or is substituted with lysine (K), and v) twelfth amino acid is serine (S) or is substituted with lysine (K) in an Hp1404 peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, and to uses thereof. The antimicrobial peptide of the present invention shows excellent antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria, gram negative bacteria, and antibiotic resistant bacteria, and has low cytotoxicity against cells derived from mice and human beings, thereby being useful as an active ingredient of antimicrobial antibiotics, cosmetic compositions, food additives, feed additives, and biopesticides."
