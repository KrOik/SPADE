                "Abstract": "The present invention provides a new methodology combining MD simulations and database-guided high-throughput screening to rationally design pore forming membrane-active peptides. The present inventive methodology is able to allow tuning of a range of structural and functional properties such as pore size and selectively targeting membranes with specific lipid compositions. The present inventive methods will ultimately allow de novo design of membrane-active peptides for a wide range of biomedical applications, including for example, antimicrobial agents."
