                "Abstract": "The present invention concerns the development and utilization of hybrid lytic peptides derived from non-venomous molecular sources to confer a high level of sustainable resistance to phytopathogens in transgenic plants. In an exemplified embodiment, a composition of the invention comprises a cecropin-pleurocidin hybrid peptide of 27 amino acids. The peptide was designed based on optimization of critical molecular and physiochemical parameters. Peptides of the invention offer significantly enhanced antimicrobial activity and molecular properties associated with low cytotoxicity. Transgenic plants of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) that express a peptide of the invention show antimicrobial activity against xylem-limited phytopathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiasa at a level significantly higher than that from other existing lytic peptides. Thus, the hybrid peptides of the invention can be utilized as an antimicrobial agent for agricultural use."
