The structure reveals distinct cationic and hydrophobic surface regions that are located on opposite sides of the molecule. (Ref.2)",

It acts as a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), and as a potent voltage- gated potassium channel (Kv) inhibitor and exhibits antimicrobial activities (By similarity). It also elicts a short-lasting hyperextension of the hind limb. It does not causes observable tissue damage (whereas the whole venom causes severe myonecrosis accompanied by edema and hemorrhage).",
