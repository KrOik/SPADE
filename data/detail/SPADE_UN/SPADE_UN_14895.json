            "Mechanism of action": "The HeV receptor-binding protein (G) is required in order for the fusion protein (F) to mediate fusion.  HeV F, once triggered by the receptor-bound G, undergoes multistep conformational changes leading to a six-helix bundle (6HB) structure that accomplishes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Peptides derived from the HRN and HRC regions of F are proposed to inhibit fusion by preventing F, after the initial triggering step, from forming the 6HB structure that is required for fusion.",
