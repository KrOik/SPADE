                "Abstract": "The present invention relates to a peptide bound to PD-L1 and uses for cancer immunotherapy and anticancer using the same, and the peptide of the present invention specifically binds to PD-L1 and inhibits it, thereby activating the function of immune cells against cancer cells and exhibiting anticancer effects. The peptides of the present invention selected two peptides (PD-L1Pep-1 and PD-L1Pep-2) that bind well to cells with high expression of human PD-L1 protein using phage peptide display technology and it was confirmed that it inhibits its function by binding to PD-L1 in humans and mice. The peptide of the present invention showed an effect similar level to that of an antibody and is relatively stable in blood, indicating a high potential as a cancer immunotherapy in the future."
