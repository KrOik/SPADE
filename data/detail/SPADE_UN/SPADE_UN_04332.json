                "Abstract": "Antimicrobial and anticancer peptides engineered using Gaegurin 5 isolated from Korean frog (Rana rugosa), which have a smaller structure compared with previously known Gaegurin peptides and show potent antimicrobial and anticancer activity. Specifically, the antimicrobial and anticancer peptides synthesized from the shortest length of Gaegurin 5, show potent antimicrobial activity against gram positive and negative strains, good safety with very low hemolytic activity and favorable advantages such as drug absorption and drug transportation due to its advantageous structural property, which can be useful as a potent antimicrobial or anticancer agent."
