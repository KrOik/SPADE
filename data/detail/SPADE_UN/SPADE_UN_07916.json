                "Abstract": "Isolated proteins having anti-fungal activity against at least Cercospora spp. The proteins contain an amino acid sequence which has at least 95% sequence identity to any of the following sequences: SEQ ID NO:3 wherein the amino acid in position 80 is alanine instead of valine, SEQ ID NO:5 and SEQ ID NO:6. Recombinant DNA molecules encoding such proteins. A vector comprising such DNA which is expressible in plants and which is linked to a plant operable promoter and terminator. Plants transformed with such recombinant DNA; the progeny of such plants which contain the DNA stably incorporated and hereditable in a Mendelian manner, and/or the seeds of such plants or such progeny."
