            "Mechanism of action": "The interaction between peptide and viral capsid proteins may cause aggregation of virions to prevent viruses from normal binding to target cells. Another possibility is that the binding of HD5 derivatives to the virion envelope blocks the epitopes of interaction between viruses and cell receptors, which are necessary for viral adsorption or entry into host cells.",
