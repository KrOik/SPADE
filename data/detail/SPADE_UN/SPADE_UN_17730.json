                "Patent Title": "Preparation and anti-tumor effect of RGD/KLA integrated lipopeptide",
                "Abstract": "The invention relates to an anticancer lipopeptide C 8 H 15 The preparation of O-Lys-Ala-Leu-Lys-Ala-Leu-Lys-Lys-Ala-Leu-Lys-Ala-Leu-Lys-Asp-Gly-Arg and the application thereof in the anti-tumor treatment belong to the field of biological medicine. The anticancer lipopeptides are prepared based on key biological features of membrane-cleavable peptides (positive charge, alpha-helical structure and amphiphilicity). The invention provides a solid-phase synthesis method of the anticancer lipopeptide. The anticancer lipopeptide has the characteristics of low hemolytic activity and good serum stability, can effectively make up the defect of high hemolytic toxicity of most anticancer peptides, and solves the problem of high hemolytic toxicity of the anticancer peptidesThe problem of poor in vivo stability of peptide drugs. In vitro anticancer experiments and in vivo antitumor experiments prove that the anticancer lipopeptide has good antitumor effect and good application prospect."
