                "Abstract": "The invention discloses a small molecular peptide and application thereof as an agonist and in an anti-cancer drug, and mainly relates to the field of bioengineering. And (2) taking an amino acid sequence 270-284 of PD-L1 as a template, and fusing with green fluorescent protein to construct and obtain the PD-L1 protein S279D hyperphosphorylation small Peptide. Can be used as an agonist to competitively inhibit the protein level interaction of PD-L1 and IGFBP3 so as to maintain the cancer inhibition function of the IGFBP3 protein."
