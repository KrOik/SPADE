                "Abstract": "This invention provides a purified polypeptide having antibacterial activity comprising a first sequence Pro-Arg-Pro-Pro-His-Pro-Arg-X1, wherein X1 is Ile or Leu; and a second sequence X2-Pro-X3-X4-X5-Pro, wherein X2 is Arg or Lys, X3 is Thr, Gln or Arg, X4 is Tyr, Gln or Pro, and X5 is Val or Ala, the second sequence is N-terminal to the first sequence. This invention also provides a purified polypeptide having antibacterial activity comprising: a first sequence, at least seven amino acid residues are the same as Pro-Arg-Pro-Pro-His-Pro-Arg-X1, wherein X1 is Ile or Leu; a second sequence X2-Pro-X3-X4X5-Pro, wherein X2 is Arg or Lys, X3 is Thr, Gln or Arg, X4 is Tyr, Gln or Pro, and X5 is Val or Ala, the second sequence is N-terminal to the first sequence; and a third sequence comprising at least five amino acid residues, at least one-third of the residues are Pro, the third sequence is N-terminal to the second sequence."
