                "Abstract": "It is an object of the present invention to provide a substance usable as an anticancer agent or DDS, which has intracellular stability, which is capable of evading side effects from functional disorder with respect to normal cells, or which has instantaneous effect. The inventors developed a novel chimeric peptide targeting cancer cells which overexpress EGFR or the like using a binding peptide such as a peptide sequence binding to EGFR, and a lytic peptide sequence, thereby solving such an object. Particularly, by using a chimeric peptide including an EGF receptor-binding peptide or the like and a cytotoxic peptide, this object was solved."
