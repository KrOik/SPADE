These peptides are related in sequence to amino acid sequences within Cathepsin G. A broad spectrum bactericidal peptide disclosed herein is RPGTLCTVAGWGRVSMRRGT (SEQ ID NO:22). It is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus aureus. RRENTQQHITARRAIRHPQY (SEQ ID NO:19) and GKSSGVPPEVFTRFVSSFLPWIRTTMR (SEQ ID NO:20) also exhibited potent activity against P, aeruginosa strains, including clinical isolates. IIGGR (SEQ ID NO:1) and IVGGR (SEQ ID NO:2) act against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial strains. HPQYNQR (SEQ ID NO:3) and certain related peptides are also active against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including, but not limited to, strains of Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, Capnocytophage sputigena and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
