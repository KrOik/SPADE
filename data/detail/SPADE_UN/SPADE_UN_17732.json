                "Abstract": "The invention provides a small molecular peptide Ped4 and application thereof. The amino acid sequence of the small molecule peptide Ped4 is FLWSRILFRLRK. The small molecular peptide Ped4 provided by the invention has the effects of inhibiting glioma cell activity, inhibiting glioma cell metastasis and inhibiting glioma cell proliferation. The small molecular peptide Ped4 has the advantages of small molecular weight, easy synthesis, high selectivity, low toxicity and the like, has obvious inhibition effect on glioma cells, the metastasis of glioma cells and the proliferation of glioma cells, and can be used as a candidate molecule of a substitute drug or an auxiliary drug of the existing anticancer drug."
