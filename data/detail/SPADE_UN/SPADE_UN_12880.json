                "Abstract": "Provided herein are synthetic peptides or synthetic fragments thereof based on a Histatin-5 peptide, for example with a sequence DSHAKRHHGYKRKFHEKHHSHRGY (SEQ ID NO: 1). The synthetic peptides or synthetic fragments have at least one substituted amino acid that is arginine and/or leucine to increase resistance to proteolytic degradation by a microbe, such as a fungus. The synthetic peptides or synthetic fragments thereof may be contained in a hydrogel. Also provided are methods for treating or preventing a pathophysiological condition via topical administration of the synthetic peptide or fragments. The pathophysiological condition may be a fungal or bacterial infection including associated inflammation or a chronic condition."
