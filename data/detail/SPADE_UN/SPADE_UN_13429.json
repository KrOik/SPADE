            "Comments": "the incorporation of β-Ala had significant influence on the antimicrobial activity of peptides mainly due to the changes of hydrophobicity and net positive charge. Ano-1β exhibited good antimicrobial potency, which was stable under physiological conditions and displayed preferable in vivo antimicrobial activity with less acute toxicity. In particular, Ano-1β showed low tendency to develop bacterial resistance in contrast to conventional antibiotics rifampicin and gentamicin, and they exhibited better anti-biofilm activity and synergistic or additive effects in combination with conventional antibiotics. Ano-1β might stands as a promising antimicrobial candidate to overcome increasing bacterial resistance, and the incorporation of β-Ala was a reasonable strategy for the development of promising antimicrobial agents.",
