                "Abstract": "The invention refers to small peptides with low hemolytic activity, presenting similar antiparasitic, antifungal and antibacterial activities. More specifically, it refers to a peptide called gomesin, with 18 amino acid residues, configured as a hairpin structure consisting of two anti-parallel beta-folded sheets joined by a beta turn, containing four invariable residues of cysteine forming two disulphide bridges, configurable as a cyclic chain with open or closed ends."
