            "Structure Description": "It differs from Siamycin I only by one amino acid. Siamycin I has a valine residue at position 4. In both peptides, disulfide bonds link Cys1 with Cys13 and Cys7 with Cys19, and the side chain of Asp9 forms an amide bond with the N-terminus (XXJ). The original has been replaced since antimicrobial assays revealed no activity.",
