                "Patent Title": "Novel use of antimicrobial peptides in regeneration of skin cells.",
                "Abstract": "Disclosed are novel antimicrobial peptides which can promote the regeneration of skin cells, thus healing wounds. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the peptides as active ingredients are also provided for wound healing and skin rejuvenation. The antimicrobial peptides exhibit inhibitory activity against antibiotic-resistant strains, and their antimicrobial activity is maintained without loss of structural stability even under a high salt condition. Also, being proven to promote the migration and regeneration of skin cells in mice as well as in vitro, the antimicrobial peptides may be widely used as an agent for regenerating skin cells. Further, they can find applications in various fields including the medical industry and the cosmetic industry. Hence, the novel antimicrobial peptides are anticipated to have considerable repercussions in the market for antibiotics, wound healing agents and cosmetics."
