                "Abstract": "The present invention relates to a cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP) showing transduction potential, as well as cytoplasmic remaining potential and various uses thereof. The CTP of this invention exhibits a transduction potential identical or higher than the conventional protein transduction, PTD, and a strong tendency to remain in the cytoplasm, so that it is very useful in inducing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and a drug delivery system (DDS) targeting cytoplasm."
