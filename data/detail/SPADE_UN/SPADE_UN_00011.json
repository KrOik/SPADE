            "Structure Description": "Active plantaricin A is composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain. The sequence of alpha chain and beta chain, however, are essential identical with the only difference being one additional Ala at the N-terminus of chain b. The 3D structure of chain a in DPC micelles has been determined by NMR spectroscopy (J Biol Chem. 2005 Jun 17;280(24):22945-50).",

            "Function": "This heat stable bacteriocin inhibits the growth of closely related Lactobacillus species. It may act as a pore-forming protein, creating a channel in the cell membrane through a \"barrel stave\" mechanism. Antibacterial activity requires both chain a (PlnA) and chain b (PlnB). The sequence of chain a and chain b, however, are essential identical with the only difference being one additional Ala at the N-terminus of chain b.",
