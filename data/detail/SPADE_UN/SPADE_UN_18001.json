                "Abstract": "The present invention relates to peptides, proteins, nucleic acids and cells for use in immunotherapeutic methods. In particular, the invention relates to immunotherapy of cancer. The invention also relates to tumor-associated T Cell (CTL) peptide epitopes, used alone or in combination with other tumor-associated peptides that stimulate an anti-tumor immune response or stimulate T cells in vitro and the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the vaccine composition transferred into the patient. Peptides that bind to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules or peptides of the same may also be targets for antibodies, soluble T cell receptors and other binding molecules."
