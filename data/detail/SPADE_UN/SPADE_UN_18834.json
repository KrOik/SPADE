Holcicola (MIC 4.25 uM), X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (MIC 17 uM), X. oryzae pv. oryzae (MIC 17 uM), and X. oryzae pv. oryzae (MIC 8.5 uM). They can cause a serious blight of rice.Antimicrobial robustness:  The peptide retains antibacterial activity after 2 hours of UV treatment and exposure to high temperatures up to 100Â°C. NaCl-insensitive:X. campestris (250 mM), NaCl-insensitive:X. oryzae (250 mM), KCl-insensitive:X. campestris (250 mM), KCl-insensitive:X. oryzae (250 mM), MgCl2-insensitive: X. campestris (62.5 mM), MgCl2-insensitive:X. oryzae (62.5 mM), CaCl2-sensitive: X. campestris (31.25 mM), CaCl2-sensitive:X. oryzae (31.25 mM).Toxicity: sheep RBC: 4xMIC peptide (3.26% hemolysis).Plant protection:rice: after 21 days treatment, the peptide partly inhibited the expansion of rice bacterial blight.",
