                "Abstract": "A construct comprising a cancer-homing peptide, an optional linker and a cell-penetrating peptide coupled to an anticancer drug and/or a diagnostic agent is disclosed. The homing peptide is for example a linear pentapeptide such as CREKA (SEQ ID NO:1), AREKA (SEQ 5 ID NO: 23) or CREKA0 (SEQ ID NO: 23), or a cyclic nonapeptide CPGPEGAGC (SEQ ID NO:2), and the cell-penetrating peptide is for example one of the peptides SEQ ID NO:3-SEQ ID NO:20. The anticancer drug may be selected from alkylating agents, antimetabolites and cytotoxic antibiotics, and the diagnostic agent may be a fluorescent label. Further, a method of delivering an anticancer drug and/or a diagnostic agent into a cancer cell 0 comprising administration of a construct according to the invention in vivo or in vitro is described."
