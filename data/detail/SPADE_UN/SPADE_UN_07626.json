                "Abstract": "Peptides which exhibit antimicrobial activity comparable to certain known antibiotics are provided. These peptides are related in sequence to amino acid sequences within Cathepsin G. A broad spectrum bactericidal peptide disclosed herein is RPGTLCTVAGWGRVSMRRGT (SEQ ID NO:22). It is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus aureus. RRENTQQHITARRAIRHPQY (SEQ ID NO:19) and GKSSGVPPEVFTRFVSSFLPWIRTTMR (SEQ ID NO:20) also exhibited potent activity against P, aeruginosa strains, including clinical isolates. IIGGR (SEQ ID NO:1) and IVGGR (SEQ ID NO:2) act against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial strains. HPQYNQR (SEQ ID NO:3) and certain related peptides are also active against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including, but not limited to, strains of Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, Capnocytophage sputigena and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The peptides of the present invention will be useful in pharmaceutical co"
