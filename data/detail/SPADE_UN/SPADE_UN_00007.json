            "Comments": "The bacteriocin was produced after 12 hours in the lag phase and the use of Diaion HP-20 hydrophobic resin increased yield. Partial sequence was determined and the entire sequence was deduced. This peptide is thermal stable, pH tolerant, and resistant to proteases. Reducing agent DTT had no effect on peptide activity or migration on gel.",
