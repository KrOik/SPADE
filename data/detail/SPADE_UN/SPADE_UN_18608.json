It has chemotactic activity (Hoffmann HJ et al., 1994).Activity: It is later established as a major AMP from human skin. Active against E. coli. Zn2+ saturated peptide is less active.MOA:bacteria:E. coli: sequstration of zinc can be an important part of skin defense against E. coli. It is found that Sustained Secretion of the Antimicrobial Peptide S100A7 is Dependent on the Downregulation of Caspase-8 (Bhatt et al., 2019).",
