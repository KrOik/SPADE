                "Abstract": "New antiviral peptides interfering the binding of the virus to DLC8. A high number of pathogenic agents of viral origin use the dynein based intracellular transport machinery at some point of their infective cycle. The present invention consists of a new antiviral therapy consisting in the inhibition of viral infections produced by those virus that use the dynein system by mechanisms of interference mainly by preventing the interaction between the viral protein and the cellular DLC8 protein. The present invention discloses for the first time the blocking of the function of this interaction by peptides whose sequence comprises or consists of the totality or a partial sequence of the viral protein corresponding to the binding domain with DLC8."
