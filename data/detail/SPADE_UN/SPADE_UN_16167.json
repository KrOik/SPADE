                "Patent Title": "Anti-angiogenic peptides",
                "Abstract": "Peptides that specifically interfere with the ability of VEGF165 to interact with the NP-1 receptor or with a VEGFR-2/NP-1 co-receptor complex are disclosed. The inventive peptides are useful to control pathological angiogenesis, such as occurs in cancer and other diseases. The peptides are based on a combination of basic residues contained within Exon 6 of human placental growth factor (PIGF), coupled at the carboxyl terminus to either Exon 8 of VEGF165 or Exon 7 of PIGF. The peptides behave as antagonists of VEGF165 signaling through a mechanism that involves competition for VEGF165 binding at either the VEGFR-2/NP-1 complex or NP-1, without affecting VEGF signaling through other pathways. This binding is sufficient to attenuate pathological angiogenesis such as occurs in tumor growth."
