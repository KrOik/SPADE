The bacterial growth in Trx-Defb1-treated group was sharply inhibited by more than 90% compared with PB and Trx groups, indicative of a lack of activity of Trx portion. It inhibits LPS-induced TNF-alpha and NO (anti-inflammatory). Another study using recombinant peptide found active against Gram+ L. monocytogenes ATCC 221,633 (MIC 60 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC 25,923 (MIC 80 ug/ml), Gram- E. coli ATCC 25,922 (MIC 30 ug/ml), and S. typhimurium ATCC 14,028 (MIC 50 ug/ml).", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not found", "Sequence Length": 67}, "extended_data_url": "SPADE_UN_18632_extended.json"}}
