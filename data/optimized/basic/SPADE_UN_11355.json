The first agent in the novel class of antiretroviral drugs called HIV fusion inhibitors, enfuvirtide works by inhibiting HIV-1 fusion with CD4 cells.", "Biological Activity": ["Anti-HIV"], "Target Organism": "IC50=15Â±3.9 nM against laboratory HIV-1 NL4-3 strain (wild-type).Higher concentrations of enfuvirtide were needed to block infection with cell-free virus, with EC50s ranging from 20 nM(HIV-1LAI in CEM cells) to 240 nM(HIV-1LAI in peripheral blood mononuclear cells)."}, "extended_data_url": "SPADE_UN_11355_extended.json"}}
