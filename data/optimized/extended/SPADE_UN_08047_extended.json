According to the present invention, an antimicrobial protein which can be obtained from a fraction of an aqueous extract of Lyophyllum shimeji precipitated by the ammonium sulfate precipitation method, has an antimicrobial activity at least against Rhizoctonia solani or Pyricularia oryzae, and shows the presence of components of about 70 kDa and/or about 65 kDa in molecular weight in the SDS-PAGE method. A gene encoding this protein and a method of using the same are provided."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_08047", "Sequence": "NAEEGTAVPYVPGYHKKNEIEFQKDIDRFV", "Sequence Length": 30, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 3 from Patent US 6881720", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "EKV", "Absent Amino Acids": "CLMOSUW", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 6, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 16, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 6, "Mass": 3494.82, "PI": 5.01, "Net Charge": -1, "Hydrophobicity": -0.91, "Similar Sequences": []}}}
