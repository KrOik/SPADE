The inventive peptides are useful to control pathological angiogenesis, such as occurs in cancer and other diseases. The peptides are based on a combination of basic residues contained within Exon 6 of human placental growth factor (PIGF), coupled at the carboxyl terminus to either Exon 8 of VEGF165 or Exon 7 of PIGF. The peptides behave as antagonists of VEGF165 signaling through a mechanism that involves competition for VEGF165 binding at either the VEGFR-2/NP-1 complex or NP-1, without affecting VEGF signaling through other pathways. This binding is sufficient to attenuate pathological angiogenesis such as occurs in tumor growth."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_16156", "Sequence": "RRPKGRGKRRREKQRPSDKPRR", "Sequence Length": 22, "Peptide Name": "P6V8CS (SEQ ID NO:5 for Patent US 20030", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RKP", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACFHILMNOTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 13, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 3, "Polar Residues": 15, "Positive Residues": 13, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 2801.23, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 11, "Hydrophobicity": -3.32, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_16154", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RRPKGRGKRRREKQRP"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_16161", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KGRGKRRREKQRPSDKPR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_16162", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KGRGKRRREKQRPSDKP"}]}}}
