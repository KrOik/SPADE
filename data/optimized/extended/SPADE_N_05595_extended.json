The peptide contributes to the cytotoxicity, inflammatory activation and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) resistance of GAS, thereby playing a role in necrosis and systemic spread. It is also responsible for the associated characteristic beta-haemolytic activity.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Listeriolysin S, a novel peptide haemolysin associated with a subset of lineage I Listeria monocytogenes.", "Pubmed ID": "18787690", "Reference": "PLoS Pathog. 2008 Sep 12;4(9)e1000144.", "Author": "Cotter PD, Draper LA, Lawton EM, Daly KM, Groeger DS, Casey PG, Ross RP, Hill C.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18787690"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CGS", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEHLMORUVW", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 5, "Polar Residues": 21, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02172", "Similarity": 0.6666666666666666, "Sequence": "SCTTCECCCSCS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07320", "Similarity": 0.6153846153846154, "Sequence": "GSGSGSGSGRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKGC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_12982", "Similarity": 0.6153846153846154, "Sequence": "GSGSRQSPSHGRHGSGSGR"}]}}}
