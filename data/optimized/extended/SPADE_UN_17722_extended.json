The CTP of this invention exhibits a transduction potential identical or higher than the conventional protein transduction, PTD, and a strong tendency to remain in the cytoplasm, so that it is very useful in inducing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and a drug delivery system (DDS) targeting cytoplasm."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17722", "Sequence": "YRRRRRRRRRR", "Sequence Length": 11, "Peptide Name": "CTP514", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RY", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFGHIKLMNOPQSTUVW", "Basic Residues": 10, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 1, "Polar Residues": 11, "Positive Residues": 10, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 1743.05, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 10, "Hydrophobicity": -4.21, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02397", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "SLQGGAPNFPQPSQQNGGWQVSPDLGRDDKGNTRGQIEIQNKGKDHDFNAGWGKVIRGPNKAKPTWHVGGTYRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03056", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "INNWVRVPPCDQVCSRTNPEKDECCRAHGHAFHATCSGGMQCYRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05496", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "INNWVRVPPCDQVCSRSNPEKDECCRAHGHAFHAHCNGGMNCYRR"}]}}}
