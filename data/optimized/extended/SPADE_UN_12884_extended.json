The synthetic peptides or synthetic fragments have at least one substituted amino acid that is arginine and/or leucine to increase resistance to proteolytic degradation by a microbe, such as a fungus. The synthetic peptides or synthetic fragments thereof may be contained in a hydrogel. Also provided are methods for treating or preventing a pathophysiological condition via topical administration of the synthetic peptide or fragments. The pathophysiological condition may be a fungal or bacterial infection including associated inflammation or a chronic condition."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_12884", "Sequence": "DSHAKRHHGYRRKFHERHHSHRGY", "Sequence Length": 24, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 10 from Patent US 10464977", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "HRG", "Absent Amino Acids": "CILMNOPQTUVW", "Basic Residues": 14, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 19, "Positive Residues": 14, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 3092.32, "PI": 10.95, "Net Charge": 12, "Hydrophobicity": -2.5, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_12878", "Similarity": 0.9583333333333334, "Sequence": "DSHAKRHHGYRRKFHEKHHSHRGY"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_12882", "Similarity": 0.9583333333333334, "Sequence": "DSHAKRHHGYKRKFHERHHSHRGY"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08542", "Similarity": 0.9285714285714286, "Sequence": "DSHAKRHHGYKRKF"}]}}}
