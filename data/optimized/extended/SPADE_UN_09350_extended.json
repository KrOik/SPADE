The protein, termed FCWP1, demonstrated significant antifungal activity against several fungal species. Mutations in proteolytic consensus sequences contained within FCWP1 improved the stability of its antifungal activity. In addition, a class of proteins related to FCWP1 was identified and characterized. This class is made up of ribosomal proteins and displayed similar values for pI and molecular weight. A representative number of proteins from this class were tested and found to have significant antifungal activities. The antifungal proteins disclosed herein are useful in controlling fungal infections in plants. Transgenic plants may be produced that are more resistant to fungal infections relative to non-transgenic plants of the same species. Alternatively, the proteins may be applied to plants exogenously."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_09350", "Sequence": "TRKKTNPFVAHHLLAKIEKVNMKEEKETIVTWSRASSILPTMVGHTIAIHNGKEHIPIYITNPMVGRKLGEFVPTRHFTSYENARKDTKSRR", "Sequence Length": 92, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 1221 from Patent US 6573361", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KTI", "Absent Amino Acids": "COQU", "Basic Residues": 23, "Acidic Residues": 8, "Hydrophobic Residues": 37, "Polar Residues": 56, "Positive Residues": 23, "Negative Residues": 8, "Mass": 10621.21, "PI": 10.28, "Net Charge": 15, "Hydrophobicity": -0.65, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_09346", "Similarity": 0.9782608695652174, "Sequence": "TRKKTNPFVAHHLLAKIEKVNMKEEKETIVTWSRASSILPAMVGHTIAIHNGKEHIPIYITNPMVGRKLGEFVPTRHFTSYESARKDTKSRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_09343", "Similarity": 0.9456521739130435, "Sequence": "TRKKTNPFVARHLLAKIEKVNMKEEKEIIVTWSRASSILPAMVGHTIAIHNGKEHIPIYITNPMVGRKLGEFVPTRHFTSYESTRKDTKSRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_09352", "Similarity": 0.7, "Sequence": "TRSLKKNPFVANHLLRKIEKLNKKAEKEIIVTWSRASTIIPTMIGHTIAIHNGREHLPIYITDRMVGHKLGEFAPTLNFRGHAKNDNKSRR"}]}}}
