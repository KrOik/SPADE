The peptides are nonhemolytic, exhibit reduced in vitro cytotoxicity relative to other antimicrobial peptides, and were well-tolerated in vivo after intravenous injection. Novispirins also bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a property that may mitigate symptoms associated with Gram-negative bacterial infection. A pharmaceutical composition comprising novispirin as an active agent is administered to a patient suffering from or predisposed to a microbial infection, particularly Gram-negative bacterial infections."}, {"Patent No": "US 6492328 B2", "Patent Link": "http://www.lens.org/lens/patent/US_6492328_B2", "Patent Type": "Granted Patent", "Publication Date": "2002-12-10", "Family Info": "None", "Patent Title": "Novispirins, Antimicrobial Peptides", "Abstract": "Novispirin peptides are antimicrobial agents with potent activity against Gramnegative bacteria.
