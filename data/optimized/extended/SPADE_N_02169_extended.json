Exhibits diverse biological activities, such as hemorrhage, hemolysis, edema, apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells or tumor cell lines, antibacterial and antiparasitic activities, as well as regulation of platelet aggregation. Its effect on platelets is controversial, since it either induces aggregation or inhibits agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions By similarity.", "Tissue specificity": "Expressed by the venom gland.", "Biophysicochemical properties": "Kinetic parameters (KM=1.89 mM for L-Ile; KM=599.7 µM for L-Leu; KM=222.8 µM for L-Met; KM=49.3 µM for L-Phe; KM=235.1 µM for L-Trp; KM=538.2 µM for L-Tyr; Vmax=6.94 µmol/min/mg enzyme toward L-Phe).", "Literature": [{"Title": "Two L-amino acid oxidase isoenzymes from Russell's viper (Daboia russelli russelli) venom with different mechanisms of inhibition by substrate analogs.", "Pubmed ID": "18384385", "Reference": "FEBS J. 2008 May;275(9)2078-2095.", "Author": "Mandal S, Bhattacharyya D.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18384385"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "DEC", "Absent Amino Acids": "HIMOQRSTUVW", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 9, "Hydrophobic Residues": 5, "Polar Residues": 7, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 9, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11340", "Similarity": 0.7333333333333333, "Sequence": "ADPRNPLEECFRETD"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02162", "Similarity": 0.7, "Sequence": "ADDKNPLEECFREDDYEGFLEIAKNGLSTTSNPKRVVIVGAGMSGLAAY"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02170", "Similarity": 0.7, "Sequence": "ADDKNPLEECFREDDYEEFLEIAKNGLKKTSNPKHIVYPVKPSEQLYEESLRDQLPTSMHRYPSMIQKIFFAGEYTANAHGWIDSTIK"}]}}}
