Specifically, the second, sixth and eleventh amino acids of Pep-1, known as cell permeable peptide, The present invention relates to an antimicrobial peptide Pep-1-K prepared by replacing glutamic acid (Glu) with lysine (Lys) and a use thereof. Pep-1-K of the present invention not only exhibits strong antimicrobial activity in various strains, especially gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and strains resistant to antibiotics, but also does not show any hemolytic activity in human erythrocyte cells. It can be usefully used as a preservative and cosmetic additive.Cell Permeable Peptides, Pep-1, Pep-1-K"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_13788", "Sequence": "KETWWKTWWTKWSQPKKKPKV", "Sequence Length": 21, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 2 from Patent KR 100811745", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KWT", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDFGHILMNORUY", "Basic Residues": 7, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 8, "Polar Residues": 13, "Positive Residues": 7, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 2787.26, "PI": 10.4, "Net Charge": 6, "Hydrophobicity": -1.94, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_10040", "Similarity": 0.9411764705882353, "Sequence": "KKTWWKTWWTKWSQPKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_28940", "Similarity": 0.9411764705882353, "Sequence": "KKTWWKTWWTKWSQPKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_29054", "Similarity": 0.9411764705882353, "Sequence": "KKTWWKTWWTKWSQPKK"}]}}}
