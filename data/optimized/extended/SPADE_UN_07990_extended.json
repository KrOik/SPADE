The present invention also relates to the useful vector for the DNA construct. The DNA construct according to the present invention comprises a first gene coding for entire, a part of or a derivative of purF gene and a second gene coding for antimicrobial peptide. According to the present invention, antimicrobial peptides can be mass-produced by the following steps: preparing an expression vector containing a DNA construct comprising a first gene coding for an entire, a part of or a derivative of purF gene and a second gene coding for antimicrobial peptide; transforming the bacterial host cells with the above-mentioned vector, culturing the transformed cell to express the above-mentioned DNA construct; and recovering the above antimicrobial peptide."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_07990", "Sequence": "GAGRGKQGGKVRAKAKTRSSRAGLQFPVGRVHRLLRKGNY", "Sequence Length": 40, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 66 from Patent US 6699689", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "GRK", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEIMOUW", "Basic Residues": 13, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 27, "Positive Residues": 13, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 4319.99, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 13, "Hydrophobicity": -0.98, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_01083", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "AGRGKQGGKVRAKAKTRSSRAGLQFPVGRVHRLLRKGNY"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_09086", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "AGRGKQGGKVRAKAKTRSS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_27329", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "AGRGKQGGKVRAKAKTRSS"}]}}}
