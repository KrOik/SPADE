Exemplified herein are the expression and use of retrocylin and protegrin. Disclosed herein are methods of engineering chloroplasts to express such antimicrobial peptides such that they are properly processed and active. Plants containing such chloroplasts are disclosed as well. The chloroplast expressed peptides are useful to delay, prevent or treat viral and bacterial infections."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03436", "Peptide Name": "Retrocyclin", "Source": "Homo sapiens (Human)", "Family": "Not found", "Gene": "DEFQ1", "Sequence": "RCICGRGICRCICGRGIC", "Sequence Length": 18, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8TEZ3"], "Protein Existence": "Predicted", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C74H136N30O19S6", "Mass": 1942.45, "PI": 9.01, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": 0.74, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1 hourYeast:2 minE.coli:2 min", "Comments": "No comments found on DRAMP database", "Literature": [{"Title": "Retrocyclin a primate peptide that protects cells from infection by T- and M-tropic strains of HIV-1.", "Pubmed ID": "11854483", "Reference": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Feb 19;99(4)1813-1818.", "Author": "Cole AM, Hong T, Boo LM, Nguyen T, Zhao C, Bristol G, Zack JA, Waring AJ, Yang OO, Lehrer RI.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11854483"}, {"Title": "Retrocyclin: a primate peptide that protects cells from infection by T- and M-tropic strains of HIV-1.", "Pubmed ID": "", "Author": "Zhao C.,Nguyen T.,Boo L.M.,Hong T.,Cole A.M."}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CGI", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADEFHKLMNOPQSTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 10, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_04783", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GICRCICGRGICRCICGR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_09517", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GYCRCICGRGICRCICGR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_09523", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RCICGRGIC"}]}}}
