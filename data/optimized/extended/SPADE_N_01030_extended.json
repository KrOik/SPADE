Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_01030", "Peptide Name": "Bombinin-like peptide 2 (BLP-2; toads, amphibians, animals)", "Source": "Bombina orientalis (Oriental fire-bellied toad)", "Family": "Belongs to the bombinin family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "GIGSAILSAGKSALKGLAKGLAEHFAN", "Sequence Length": 27, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P29003"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram-", "Antifungal"], "Target Organism": "[Ref.1744108]Gram-negative bacterium:58% inhibition Neisseria meningitidis 118V C (MIC=20 µg/ml), 98% inhibition Neisseria meningitidis 15240 IAI (MIC=20 µg/ml), 98% inhibition Neisseria meningitidis 126E IC1 (MIC=20 µg/ml), 97% inhibition Neisseria gonorrhoeoe F62 (MIC=20 µg/ml), 99% inhibition Neisseria Iactamica 15323 (MIC=20 µg/ml), 100% inhibition Neisseria Iactamica 15215A (MIC=20 µg/ml), 95% inhibition Neisseria cinerea 15461 (MIC=20 µg/ml).", "Hemolytic Activity": "[Ref:1744108] No significant hemolytic activity was found which suggests a selectivity for prokaryotic over eukaryotic membranes.", "Cytotoxicity": "No cytotoxicity information found in the reference(s) presented", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Cyclic", "N-terminal Modification": "Free", "C-terminal Modification": "Amidation", "Stereochemistry": "L", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C115H193N33O34", "Mass": 2581.96, "PI": 9.7, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": 0.43, "Half Life": "Mammalian:30 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Has antimicrobial activity, but no hemolytic activity.
