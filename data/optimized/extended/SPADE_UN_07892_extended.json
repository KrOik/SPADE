DNA encoding the proteins may be isolated and incorporated into vectors. Plants transformed with this DNA may be produced. The proteins find commerical application as antifungal or antibacterial agents; transformed plants will show increased disease-resistance. The invention further provides a method of expressing polyproteins in transgenic plants using DNA constructs based on the structure of the gene encoding the Impatiens antimicrobial proteins."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_07892", "Sequence": "QSAEEAAAFQAGEVTASLMLIMFKACPCMGPVPSV", "Sequence Length": 35, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 20 from Patent US 5861480", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "AEM", "Absent Amino Acids": "DHNORUWY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 3, "Hydrophobic Residues": 21, "Polar Residues": 19, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 3, "Mass": 3586.2, "PI": 4.25, "Net Charge": -2, "Hydrophobicity": 0.67, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_12189", "Similarity": 0.5, "Sequence": "AAAAAAAAAK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_19787", "Similarity": 0.5, "Sequence": "AAAAAAAAAK"}]}}}
