The present invention further concerns the use of such agents for the treatment of bacterial infections in animals, including man. The agents are derivatives of vancomycin-type antibiotics, of structure: V-L-W-X; wherein V is a glycopeptide moiety which inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis in bacteria; L is a linking group; W is a peptidic membrane-associating element such as an element based on naturally-occurring animal or bacterial peptide antibiotics; and X is hydrogen or a membrane-insertive element."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11313", "Sequence": "SKDGKKKKKKSKTK", "Sequence Length": 14, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 8 from Patent US 7078380", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KSD", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACEFHILMNOPQRUVWY", "Basic Residues": 9, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 0, "Polar Residues": 12, "Positive Residues": 9, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 1618.96, "PI": 10.54, "Net Charge": 8, "Hydrophobicity": -2.95, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05864", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KILRGVCKKIMRTFLRRISKDILTGKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07253", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KILRGVAKKILRTFLRRISKDILTGKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11762", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KILRGVCKKIMRPFLRRISKDILTGKK"}]}}}
