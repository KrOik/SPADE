In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_04209", "Sequence": "GFGCPNNYQCHRHCKSIPGRCGGYCGGXHRLRCTCYRC", "Sequence Length": 38, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 58 from Patent US 20080269122", "Source": "Mytilus galloprovincialis", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CGR", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADEMOUVW", "Basic Residues": 9, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 8, "Polar Residues": 25, "Positive Residues": 9, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02426", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GFGCPNNYQCHRHCKSIPGRCGGYCGGWHRLRCTCYRC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07862", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GFGCPNNYQCHRHCKSIPGRCGGYCGGWHRLRCTCYRCG"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08993", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "CKSIPGRCG"}]}}}
