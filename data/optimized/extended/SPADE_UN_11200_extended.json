In particular, the peptide molecules exhibit a high antimicrobial activity against numerous bacterial species, with reduced cytotoxicity and a low haemolysis rate. The molecules of the invention are advantageously usable as therapeutic agents and coadjutants against infections caused by strains that are resistant to common antibiotics."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11200", "Sequence": "QEKIRVRLSA", "Sequence Length": 10, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 1 from Patent US 20090053151", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RAE", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDFGHMNOPTUWY", "Basic Residues": 3, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 7, "Positive Residues": 3, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 1199.4, "PI": 10.84, "Net Charge": 2, "Hydrophobicity": -0.64, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_07573", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RWQEK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_10186", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "EQIWNNMTWMEWDREINNYTSLIHSLIEESQNQQEK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_10240", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "YTSLIHSLIEESQNQQEK"}]}}}
