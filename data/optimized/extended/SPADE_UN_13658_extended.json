Development of new AMPs is arduous due to the practical limitations of classical protein-based discovery approaches. A high throughput bioinformatics approach is described which is able to confirm identification of known AMPs from the North American bullfrog ( Rana ( Lithobates ) catesbeiana ) genome, and a bioinformatics approach is used to develop new AMPs. The described AMPs exhibit antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis via microtitre broth dilution assays, indicating broader efficacy."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_13658", "Sequence": "MRKRMTMRRMMKKKKSEKERRERGKRMMRVMRRKTKVIWEKKDFIGLYSID", "Sequence Length": 51, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 28 from Patent US 2022/0125873", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KRM", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACHNOPQU", "Basic Residues": 22, "Acidic Residues": 6, "Hydrophobic Residues": 17, "Polar Residues": 29, "Positive Residues": 22, "Negative Residues": 6, "Mass": 6580.07, "PI": 11.63, "Net Charge": 16, "Hydrophobicity": -1.48, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13641", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MRKRMTMRRMMKKKKSEKERRERGKR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05861", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MMRVMRRKTKVIWEKKDFIGLYSID"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13657", "Similarity": 0.9285714285714286, "Sequence": "MFTMKKSEKERRERGKRMMRVMRRKTKVIWEKKDFIGLYSID"}]}}}
