In particular the present invention relates to retroviral vectors. Furthermore, the present invention relates to retroviral vectors which undergo promoter conversion (Procon vectors) carrying such sequences. Since these vectors also carry tumour or virus specific regulatory elements, the therapeutic antimicrobial peptide will be delivered and expressed only in relevant, affected cells and not in innocent bystander cells."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_08118", "Sequence": "GIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISWIGGGGGG", "Sequence Length": 26, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 2 from Patent US 7022319", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "GLI", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEFHMNOQRUY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 8, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 2364.78, "PI": 8.75, "Net Charge": 1, "Hydrophobicity": 1.1, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05970", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GIGAVLKVL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06727", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KIAKVALAKLGIGAVLKVLTTGL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00365", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KWKLFKKIEKVGQGIGAVLKVLTTGL"}]}}}
