The inventors developed a novel chimeric peptide targeting cancer cells which overexpress EGFR or the like using a binding peptide such as a peptide sequence binding to EGFR, and a lytic peptide sequence, thereby solving such an object. Particularly, by using a chimeric peptide including an EGF receptor-binding peptide or the like and a cytotoxic peptide, this object was solved."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11061", "Sequence": "MEPVDPRLEPWKHPGSQPKTACTNCYCKKCCFHCQVCFITKALGISYGRKKRRQRRRAHQNSQTHQASLSKQPTSQPRGDPTGPKE", "Sequence Length": 86, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 57 from Patent US 20110319336", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KPQ", "Absent Amino Acids": "OU", "Basic Residues": 21, "Acidic Residues": 5, "Hydrophobic Residues": 26, "Polar Residues": 58, "Positive Residues": 21, "Negative Residues": 5, "Mass": 9837.21, "PI": 9.88, "Net Charge": 16, "Hydrophobicity": -1.21, "Similar Sequences": []}}}
