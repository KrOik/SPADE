The novel peptides exhibit broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi by effecting modification of the primary peptide structure. Further, the peptides exhibit improved serum compatibility and reduced hemolysis."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_01387", "Sequence": "IXRVXRRXK", "Sequence Length": 9, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 5 from Patent US 20060128614", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RXI", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFGHLMNOPQSTUWY", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 2, "Polar Residues": 5, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02689", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GKPRPYSPRPTSHPRPIRV"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08490", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GKPRPYTPRPTSHPRPIRV"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08641", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GKPRPYPRPSHPRPIRV"}]}}}
