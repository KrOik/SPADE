Exhibits diverse biological activities, such as hemorrhage, hemolysis, edema, antibacterial and antiparasitic activities, as well as regulation of platelet aggregation. Its effect on platelets is controversial, since it either induces aggregation or inhibits agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions (By similarity). In addition, this protein induces apoptosis and necrosis and has inhibitory effects on rat kidney Function", "Tissue specificity": "Expressed by the venom gland.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Purification and biological effects of L-amino acid oxidase isolated from Bothrops insularis venom.", "Pubmed ID": "17983639", "Reference": "Toxicon. 2008 Feb;51(2)199-207.", "Author": "Braga MD, Martins AM, Amora DN, de Menezes DB, Toyama MH, Toyama DO, Marangoni S, Alves CD, Barbosa PS, de Sousa Alves R, Fonteles MC, Monteiro HS.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17983639"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "AEG", "Absent Amino Acids": "HOQUW", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 9, "Hydrophobic Residues": 21, "Polar Residues": 24, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 9, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00179", "Similarity": 0.9, "Sequence": "ADDRNPLEECFRETDYEEFLEIAKNGLSTT"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02166", "Similarity": 0.8888888888888888, "Sequence": "ADDKNPLEEAFREADYEVFLEIAKNGL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02163", "Similarity": 0.8648648648648649, "Sequence": "ADDKNPLEECFRETDYEEFLEIARNGLKATSNPKRVV"}]}}}
