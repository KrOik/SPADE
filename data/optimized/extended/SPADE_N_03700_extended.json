The present invention relates to novel antimicrobial peptides and derivatives thereof as well as the beta-defensin genes encoding the peptides. The invention further relates to methods of use of the peptides including a method of inhibiting microbial growth by administering an effective amount of the peptide alone or in combination with other antimicrobial agents or antibiotics."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03700", "Sequence": "DECPSEYYHCRLKCNADEHAIRYCADFSICCKL", "Sequence Length": 33, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 26 from Patent US 20030176652", "Source": "Homo sapiens", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CAD", "Absent Amino Acids": "GMOQTUVW", "Basic Residues": 6, "Acidic Residues": 6, "Hydrophobic Residues": 12, "Polar Residues": 21, "Positive Residues": 6, "Negative Residues": 6, "Mass": 3900.4, "PI": 5.41, "Net Charge": 0, "Hydrophobicity": -0.45, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02322", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "FISNDECPSEYYYHCRLKCNADEHAIRYCADFSICCKLKIIEIHGQKKW"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03174", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "FISNDECPSEYYHCRLKCNADEHAIRYCADFSICCKLKIIEIDGQKKW"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_04015", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "DECPSEYYHCRLKCNADEHAIRYCADFSICCKLKI"}]}}}
