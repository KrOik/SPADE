Exemplified herein are the expression and use of retrocylin and protegrin. Disclosed herein are methods of engineering chloroplasts to express such antimicrobial peptides such that they are properly processed and active. Plants containing such chloroplasts are disclosed as well. The chloroplast expressed peptides are useful to delay, prevent or treat viral and bacterial infections."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02573", "Peptide Name": "Protegrin-4 (Protegrin 4; PG-4; pigs, mammals, animals)", "Source": "Sus scrofa (Pig)", "Family": "Belongs to the cathelicidin family", "Gene": "NPG4", "Sequence": "RGGRLCYCRGWICFCVGR", "Sequence Length": 18, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P49933"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Antifungal"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C90H141N31O20S4", "Mass": 2105.54, "PI": 9.37, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": 0.19, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1 hourYeast:2 minE.coli:2 min", "Function": "Microbicidal activity (By similarity).", "PTM": "Contains two disulfide bonds (By similarity).", "Literature": [{"Title": "Identification of a new member of the protegrin family by cDNA cloning.", "Pubmed ID": "8013647", "Reference": "FEBS Lett. 1994; 346 285-288.", "Author": "Zhao C, Liu L, Lehrer RI.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8013647"}, {"Title": "NMR structure of the cathelin-like domain of the protegrin-3 precursor.", "Pubmed ID": "12705830", "Reference": "ochemistry. 2003 Apr 29;42(16)4669-4680.", "Author": "Yang Y, Sanchez JF, Strub MP, Brutscher B, Aumelas A.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12705830"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CGR", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADEHKMNOPQSTU", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 10, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_12922", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GRRGGRGGR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11330", "Similarity": 0.8235294117647058, "Sequence": "RGGLCYCRGRFCVCVGR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02574", "Similarity": 0.7777777777777778, "Sequence": "RGGRLCYCRPRFCVCVGR"}]}}}
