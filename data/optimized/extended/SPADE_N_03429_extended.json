In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03429", "Peptide Name": "Beta defensin-2", "Source": "Capra hircus (Goat)", "Family": "Not found", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "MRLHHLLLALFFLVLSAGSGFTQGIINHRSCYRNKGVCAPARCPRNMRQIGTCHGPPVKCCRKK", "Sequence Length": 64, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O97942"], "Protein Existence": "Predicted", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C312H512N102O76S8", "Mass": 7164.56, "PI": 10.56, "Net Charge": 15, "Hydrophobicity": -0.07, "Half Life": "Mammalian:30 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Comments": "No comments found on DRAMP database", "Literature": [{"Title": "Differential expression of caprine beta-defensins in digestive and respiratory tissues.", "Pubmed ID": "10531296", "Reference": "Infect Immun. 1999 Nov;67(11)6221-6224.", "Author": "Zhao C, Nguyen T, Liu L, Shamova O, Brogden K, Lehrer RI.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10531296"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LRC", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEOUW", "Basic Residues": 15, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 27, "Polar Residues": 39, "Positive Residues": 15, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03979", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "QGIINHRSCYRNKGVCAPARCPRNMRQIGTCHGPPVKCCRKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03381", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "NHRSCYRNKGVCAPARCPRNMRQIGTCHGPPVKCCRKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05755", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "NHRSCYRNKGVCAPARCPRNMRQIGTCHGPPVKCCR"}]}}}
