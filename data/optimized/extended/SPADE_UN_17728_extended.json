It also relates to methods of using the system in diagnosis of diseases, as research tool and as a targeting system, a composition comprising the system and especially a pharmaceutical composition a material covered with the system and a material having the delivery systems into the material. Finally it relates to novel peptides."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17728", "Sequence": "RKKRKKKRXRHXRHXRHXR", "Sequence Length": 19, "Peptide Name": "Pepfect 1", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RKX", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFGILMNOPQSTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 15, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 0, "Polar Residues": 15, "Positive Residues": 15, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_10517", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ELDRICGYGTARCRKKR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_05438", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "YWWLWRKKR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_05960", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KRRKLIKILKLIIKLIRKKR"}]}}}
