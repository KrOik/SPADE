DNA encoding the proteins may be isolated and incorporated into vectors. Plants transformed with this DNA may be produced. The proteins find commerical application as antifungal or antibacterial agents; transformed plants will show increased disease-resistance. The invention further provides a method of expressing polyproteins in transgenic plants using DNA constructs based on the structure of the gene encoding the Impatiens antimicrobial proteins."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_07882", "Sequence": "GRRCCNWGPGRRYCKRWC", "Sequence Length": 18, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 2 from Patent US 5861480", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RCG", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADEFHILMOQSTUV", "Basic Residues": 6, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 12, "Positive Residues": 6, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 2257.65, "PI": 10.16, "Net Charge": 6, "Hydrophobicity": -1.43, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00935", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "QYGRRCCNWGPGRRYCKRWC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08722", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "YGRRCCNWGPGRRYCKRWC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_07885", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GPGRRY"}]}}}
