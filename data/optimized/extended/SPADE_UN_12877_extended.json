The synthetic peptides or synthetic fragments have at least one substituted amino acid that is arginine and/or leucine to increase resistance to proteolytic degradation by a microbe, such as a fungus. The synthetic peptides or synthetic fragments thereof may be contained in a hydrogel. Also provided are methods for treating or preventing a pathophysiological condition via topical administration of the synthetic peptide or fragments. The pathophysiological condition may be a fungal or bacterial infection including associated inflammation or a chronic condition."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_12877", "Sequence": "DSHALRHHGYKRKFHEKHHSHRGY", "Sequence Length": 24, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 3 from Patent US 10464977", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "HKR", "Absent Amino Acids": "CIMNOPQTUVW", "Basic Residues": 13, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 5, "Polar Residues": 18, "Positive Residues": 13, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 3021.28, "PI": 10.16, "Net Charge": 11, "Hydrophobicity": -2.13, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_23301", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "DSHAGYKRKFHEKHHSHRGY"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08545", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "HHGYKRKFHEKH"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_29412", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "HHGYKRKFHEKH"}]}}}
