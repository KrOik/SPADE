Can induce cell death via autophagy and apoptosis and this occurs through the cross-talk of mitochondria and lysosomes via reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the process involves BNIP3. Can regulate neutrophil number and apoptosis by an anti-apoptotic effect. Death at an early embryonic stage due to embryo resorption, starting about 8 days after fertilization.", "Miscellaneous": "Binds two calcium ions per molecule with an affinity similar to that of the S100 proteins (By similarity).", "Literature": [{"Title": "Mouse MRP8 and MRP14, two intracellular calcium-binding proteins associated with the development of the myeloid lineage.", "Pubmed ID": "1373330", "Reference": "Blood. 1992 Apr 15;79(8)1907-15.", "Author": "Lagasse E, Weissman IL.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1373330"}, {"Title": "Mrp8 and Mrp14 are endogenous activators of Toll-like receptor 4, promoting lethal, endotoxin-induced shock.", "Pubmed ID": "17767165", "Reference": "Nat Med. 2007 Sep;13(9)1042-9.", "Author": "Vogl T, Tenbrock K, Ludwig S, Leukert N, Ehrhardt C, van Zoelen MA, Nacken W, Foell D, van der Poll T, Sorg C, Roth J.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17767165"}, {"Title": "S100A8 and S100A9 mediate endotoxin-induced cardiomyocyte dysfunction via the receptor for advanced glycation end products.", "Pubmed ID": "18403730", "Reference": "Circ Res. 2008 May 23;102(10)1239-46.", "Author": "Boyd JH, Kan B, Roberts H, Wang Y, Walley KR.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18403730"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "NEI", "Absent Amino Acids": "OUW", "Basic Residues": 13, "Acidic Residues": 13, "Hydrophobic Residues": 37, "Polar Residues": 50, "Positive Residues": 13, "Negative Residues": 13, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03023", "Similarity": 0.7954545454545454, "Sequence": "ATELEKALSNVIEVYHNYSGIKGNHHALYRDDFRKMVTTECPQFVQNKNTESLFKELDVNSDNAINFEEFLVLVIRVGVAAHKDSHKE"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03180", "Similarity": 0.5795454545454546, "Sequence": "MLTELEKALNSIIDVYHKYSLIKGNFHAVYRDDLKKLLETECPQYIRKKGADVWFKELDINTDGAVNFQEFLILVIKMGVAAHKKSHEESHKE"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02443", "Similarity": 0.5227272727272727, "Sequence": "MLTDLECAINSLIDVYHKYSLKKGNYHAVYRDDLKQLLETECPKFMKKKDADTWFKELDINQDGGINFEEFLVLVIKVGLEAHEEIHKE"}]}}}
