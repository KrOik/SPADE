In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_04203", "Sequence": "GIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISWISRKKRQQ", "Sequence Length": 27, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 25 from Patent US 20080269122", "Source": "Apis mellifera", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LGI", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEFHMNOUY", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 15, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 2934.52, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 5, "Hydrophobicity": 0.23, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05970", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GIGAVLKVL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06727", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KIAKVALAKLGIGAVLKVLTTGL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07867", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISWIRKKRQQ"}]}}}
