The coiled-coil structures made by the methods disclosed within this specification mimic all or a portion of the internal, trimeric coiled-coil motif contained within the fusogenic conformation of an enveloped virus membrane-fusion protein, particularly the internal coiled-coil domain of the HIV gp41 ectodomain. The HIV-derived, chimeric peptides disclosed comprise a non-HIV, soluble, trimeric form of a coiled-coil fused in helical phase to all or a portion of the N-helix of HIV gp41 and are covalently-stabilized in a homotrimeric or heterotrimeric coiled-coil structure through the formation of disulfide or chemoselective bonds between said peptides. The covalently-stabilized, HIV-derived, homotrimeric or heterotrimeric coiled-coil structures made by the methods disclosed herein represent a close mimetic of a HIV gp41 fusion intermediate and ar"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_10741", "Sequence": "AVERYLK", "Sequence Length": 7, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 49 from Patent US 7811577", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antiviral"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "AEK", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDFGHIMNOPQSTUW", "Basic Residues": 2, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 5, "Positive Residues": 2, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 878.03, "PI": 8.63, "Net Charge": 1, "Hydrophobicity": -0.49, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_04298", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "SSLLEKGLDGAKKAVGGLGKLGKDAVE"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_04802", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "TLTVQARQLLSGIVQQQNNLLRAIEAQQHLLQLTVWGIKQLQARILAVERYLKDQLLGI"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_11919", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KKFGGGKTERARKAMAVE"}]}}}
