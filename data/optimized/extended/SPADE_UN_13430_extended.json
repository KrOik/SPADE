Ano-8β exhibited good antimicrobial potency, which was stable under physiological conditions and displayed preferable in vivo antimicrobial activity with less acute toxicity. In particular, Ano-8β showed low tendency to develop bacterial resistance in contrast to conventional antibiotics rifampicin and gentamicin, and they exhibited better anti-biofilm activity and synergistic or additive effects in combination with conventional antibiotics. Ano-8β might stands as a promising antimicrobial candidate to overcome increasing bacterial resistance, and the incorporation of β-Ala was a reasonable strategy for the development of promising antimicrobial agents.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Synthesis and anti-pseudomonal activity of new ß-Ala modified analogues of the antimicrobial peptide anoplin", "Pubmed ID": "32654770", "Reference": "Int J Med Microbiol. 2020 Jul;310(5)151433. doi 10.1016/j.ijmm.2020.151433.
