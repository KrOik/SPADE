Specifically, the invention relates to an isolated polypeptide, the amino acid sequence of which is that one or more amino acids in a mother sequence are removed, or one or more amino acids in the mother sequence are replaced by L-type amino acids or D-type amino acids with the same number, wherein the mother sequence is SEQ ID NO. 1, SEQ ID NO. 62 or SEQ ID NO. 63; and the polypeptide has activity of blocking alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChR. The polypeptide can specifically block alpha 9 alpha 10nAChR, and has good application prospect in the aspects of preparing analgesic drugs, drugs for treating mental diseases and cancers, neuroscience tool drugs and the like."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17868", "Sequence": "TCRSSGRYCRSPYDRRRRYCAAITDACV", "Sequence Length": 28, "Peptide Name": "[R21A, R22A]GeXIVA[1,2]", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RCA", "Absent Amino Acids": "EFHKLMNOQUW", "Basic Residues": 7, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 9, "Polar Residues": 23, "Positive Residues": 7, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 3286.71, "PI": 9.57, "Net Charge": 5, "Hydrophobicity": -0.86, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17870", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RSPYDRRRRY"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17850", "Similarity": 0.9642857142857143, "Sequence": "TCRSSGRYCRSPYDRRRRYCARITDACV"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17851", "Similarity": 0.9642857142857143, "Sequence": "TCRSSGRYCRSPYDRRRRYCRAITDACV"}]}}}
