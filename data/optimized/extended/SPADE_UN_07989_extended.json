The present invention also relates to the useful vector for the DNA construct. The DNA construct according to the present invention comprises a first gene coding for entire, a part of or a derivative of purF gene and a second gene coding for antimicrobial peptide. According to the present invention, antimicrobial peptides can be mass-produced by the following steps: preparing an expression vector containing a DNA construct comprising a first gene coding for an entire, a part of or a derivative of purF gene and a second gene coding for antimicrobial peptide; transforming the bacterial host cells with the above-mentioned vector, culturing the transformed cell to express the above-mentioned DNA construct; and recovering the above antimicrobial peptide."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_07989", "Sequence": "GVLSNVIGIGYLKKLGTGALNAVLKQ", "Sequence Length": 26, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 60 from Patent US 6699689", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "GLK", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEFHMOPRUW", "Basic Residues": 3, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 14, "Positive Residues": 3, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 2627.13, "PI": 10.0, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": 0.66, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_01999", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GVLSNVIGYLKKLGTGALNAVLKQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_01638", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GVLSNVIGYLKKLGTGALNAVLKQC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13099", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GVLSNVIGYLKKLTGALNALKQ"}]}}}
