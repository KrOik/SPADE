A method for inhibiting fungal colonization of plants is described which includes preparation of nucleotide sequences encoding the modified antifungal protein, preparation of vectors containing the nucleotide coding sequence, and methods for transforming plants with the nucleotide sequences. The polypeptide can be formulated into compositions useful in controlling plant pathogenic fungi."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_09501", "Sequence": "RTCENLARKYRGPCFSGCDTHCTTKENAVSGRCRDDFRCWCTKRC", "Sequence Length": 45, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 4 from Patent US 7728190", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CRT", "Absent Amino Acids": "IMOQU", "Basic Residues": 11, "Acidic Residues": 5, "Hydrophobic Residues": 9, "Polar Residues": 32, "Positive Residues": 11, "Negative Residues": 5, "Mass": 5235.93, "PI": 8.94, "Net Charge": 6, "Hydrophobicity": -0.97, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_11225", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GRCRDDFRCWCTKRC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_30432", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GRCRDDFRCWCTKRC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07925", "Similarity": 0.9777777777777777, "Sequence": "MEKKSLAGLCFLFLVLFVAQEIVVTEARTCENLADKYRGPCFSGCDTHCTTKENAVSGRCRDDFRCWCTKRC"}]}}}
