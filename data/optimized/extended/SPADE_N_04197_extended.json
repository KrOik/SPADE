In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_04197", "Sequence": "MNFVRILSFVFALVLALGAVSAAPEPRWKLFKKIEKVGRNVRDGLIKAGPAIAVIGQAKSLGK", "Sequence Length": 63, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 9 from Patent US 20080269122", "Source": "Bombyx mori", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "AKL", "Absent Amino Acids": "CHOTUY", "Basic Residues": 11, "Acidic Residues": 3, "Hydrophobic Residues": 37, "Polar Residues": 33, "Positive Residues": 11, "Negative Residues": 3, "Mass": 6762.11, "PI": 11.13, "Net Charge": 8, "Hydrophobicity": 0.49, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03089", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RWKLFKKIEKVGRNVRDGLIKAGPAIAVIGQAKSL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06520", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RWKLFKKIEKVGRNVRDGLIKAGPAIAVIGQAKSLGK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_21606", "Similarity": 0.9090909090909091, "Sequence": "RWKIFKKIEKVGRNVRDGIIKA"}]}}}
