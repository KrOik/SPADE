The composition can also include an effective amount of at least one of a growth factor and a neuropeptide. The present invention also relates a method of treating an injury to a nervous system of an animal that includes the steps of identifying the injury to the nervous system and applying to the injury an effective amount of at least one of antimicrobial peptide and a substance having an antimicrobial peptide effect. The method can also include applying an effective amount of one or more trophic factors selected from the group consisting of a growth factor, a neurotrophin, and a neuropeptide to the injury."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02382", "Peptide Name": "Ponericin-W5 (ants, insects, animals)", "Source": "Pachycondyla goeldii (Ponerine ant)", "Family": "Belongs to the ponericin-W family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "FWGALIKGAAKLIPSVVGLFKKKQ", "Sequence Length": 24, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P82427"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-", "Insecticidal", "Antifungal"], "Target Organism": "[Ref.11279030]Gram-positive bacteria:Bacillus cereus CIP 6624a(Inhibition zone = 7mm), B. megaterium ATCC 9885b(Inhibition zone = 12mm), B. stearothermophilus CIP 675(Inhibition zone = 17mm), B. subtilis ATCC 6623(Inhibition zone = 13mm), Enterococcus faecalis CIP 636(Inhibition zone = 3mm), Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris I116(Inhibition zone = 11mm), Streptococcus pyogenes CIP 561(Inhibition zone = 6.5mm), S. sanguinis CIP 55128(Inhibition zone = 4.5mm), Listeria ivanovii LMA 94d(Inhibition zone = 8mm), Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 15313(Inhibition zone = 6.5mm), Micrococcus luteus CIP 5345(Inhibition zone = 11mm), Staphylococcus aureus CIP 677(Inhibition zone = 7.5mm), Staphylococcus aureus LMA(Inhibition zone = 9mm), S. epidermidis CIP 53134(Inhibition zone = 7.5mm);Gram-negative bacteria:Escherichia coli(Inhibition zone = 3mm), Enterobacter cloacae CIP 6085(Inhibition zone = 11mm), Klebsiella pneumoniae CIP 8291(Inhibition zone = 6.5mm), Proteus mirabilis LMA TP(no detected), Salmonella enterica CIP 813(no detected), Serratia marcescens LMA TP(Inhibition zone = 11mm), Flavobacterium meningosepticum CIP 6057(Inhibition zone = 5mm), Pseudomonas aeruginosa CIP A22(Inhibition zone = 14mm).", "Hemolytic Activity": "[Ref.11279030]4mm in test condition against horse erythrocytes (A 12-ml sample of blood agar medium was supplemented with 1 ml of sheep or horse erythrocytes.
