The endothelial chalone 33 peptide is composed of 24 peptide which forms the anti-angiogenesis activity of the endothelial chalone, RGDRD sequence and QRD sequence, and the amino acid sequence is shown as SEQ ID NO. 1. Experiments prove that the endostatin 33 peptide has broad-spectrum anti-tumor activity, especially on high-expression alpha6Î²1Specific anticancer function of subtype prostate cancer tissue. The invention provides a method for solving the problem that the curative effect is poor when the prior 30 peptide endostatin is used for treating tumors with integrin subtypes which cannot be identified by RGD sequenceThe treatment of prostate cancer provides a new and effective technical means."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17737", "Sequence": "QRDMHSHRDFQPVLVALNSPLSGGMRDRG", "Sequence Length": 29, "Peptide Name": "SEQ ID NO.1 of Patent CN113912739A", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RDG", "Absent Amino Acids": "CEIKOTUWY", "Basic Residues": 6, "Acidic Residues": 3, "Hydrophobic Residues": 11, "Polar Residues": 15, "Positive Residues": 6, "Negative Residues": 3, "Mass": 3277.65, "PI": 9.46, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": -0.83, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06267", "Similarity": 0.9565217391304348, "Sequence": "HSHRDFQPVLHLVALNSPLSGGMRG"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07185", "Similarity": 0.76, "Sequence": "HTHQDFQPVLHLVALNTPLSGGMRGIR"}]}}}
