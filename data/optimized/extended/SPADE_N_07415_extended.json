The cyclic cyclo-chromo-threo-casein-isoleucin-phenylpropanoid is prepared from cyclo-tryptophan, threonine, tyrosine, isoleucine and phenylalanine, and is a pentadecatomic cyclic pentapeptide formed by connecting amide bonds. This is a novel compound and has not been reported in the literature. The compound of the invention can be obtained by culturing ranunculus japonicus and then extracting and separating. The pure product of the cyclocyclo-chromo-threo-casein-isoleucin is white powder and has half Inhibition Concentration (IC) on hepatoma carcinoma cell HepG2 50 ) Comprises the following steps: 111.07. Mu.g/mL, half inhibitory concentration of alpha-glucosidase (IC) 50 ) Comprises the foll"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_07415", "Sequence": "WTYIF", "Sequence Length": 5, "Peptide Name": "coloy(Trp-Thr-Tyr-Ile-Phe)", "Source": "Frog fecal mildew", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "FIT", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEGHKLMNOPQRSUV", "Basic Residues": 0, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 2, "Positive Residues": 0, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 728.83, "PI": 5.52, "Net Charge": 0, "Hydrophobicity": 0.88, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_18101", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "STAKSATWTY"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_15223", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "YIFYLAT"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_13102", "Similarity": 0.75, "Sequence": "IEWGNVSRQPKPKATYI"}]}}}
