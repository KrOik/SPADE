The inventors developed a novel chimeric peptide targeting cancer cells which overexpress EGFR or the like using a binding peptide such as a peptide sequence binding to EGFR, and a lytic peptide sequence, thereby solving such an object. Particularly, by using a chimeric peptide including an EGF receptor-binding peptide or the like and a cytotoxic peptide, this object was solved."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11024", "Sequence": "RLLRRLLRRLLRRLLRRLLR", "Sequence Length": 20, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 12 from Patent US 20110319336", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LR", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFGHIKMNOPQSTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 10, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 10, "Polar Residues": 10, "Positive Residues": 10, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 2711.45, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 10, "Hydrophobicity": -0.35, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08456", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RLLRRLLRRLLRLQKKGI"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_11714", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RLLRFFRKLKKSV"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_11715", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RLLRFFRLKKSV"}]}}}
