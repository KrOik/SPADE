A method for inhibiting fungal colonization of plants is described which includes preparation of nucleotide sequences encoding the modified antifungal protein, preparation of vectors containing the nucleotide coding sequence, and methods for transforming plants with the nucleotide sequences. The polypeptide can be formulated into compositions useful in controlling plant pathogenic fungi."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_00386", "Peptide Name": "Defensin-like protein 1 (Gamma-1-purothionin; Plant defensin)", "Source": "Triticum aestivum (Wheat)", "Family": "Belongs to the DEFL family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "KICRRRSAGFKGPCMSNKNCAQVCQQEGWGGGNCDGPFRRCKCIRQC", "Sequence Length": 47, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P20158"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antifungal"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Gamma 1-P has a well-defined triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet (residues 1-6, 31-34, and 39-47), an alpha-helix (residues 16-28), and the corresponding connecting loops.
