Fusion proteins comprising a periplasmic targeting signal, cleavage site, and antimicrobial peptides provide the basis for this process which produces antimicrobial peptides that may be used in antimicrobial compositions and articles."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_01612", "Sequence": "MKKLLFAIPLVVPFYSHSKGLKKLLKGLKKLLKLHHHHHH", "Sequence Length": 40, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 7 from Patent US 20070122425", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LKH", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDENOQRTUW", "Basic Residues": 16, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 20, "Polar Residues": 22, "Positive Residues": 16, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 4716.82, "PI": 10.6, "Net Charge": 16, "Hydrophobicity": -0.11, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02630", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "INWKGIAAMKKLL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_04179", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MKKLLFAIPLVVPFYSHS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_01610", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MKKLLFAIPLVVPFYSHSDPKGLKKLLKGLKKLLKL"}]}}}
