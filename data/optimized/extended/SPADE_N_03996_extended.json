Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03996", "Sequence": "VTCDLLSFKGQVNDSACAANCLSLGKAGGHCEKGVCICRKTSFKDLWDKYF", "Sequence Length": 51, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 105 from Patent US 20050260715", "Source": "Apis mellifera", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CKG", "Absent Amino Acids": "MOPU", "Basic Residues": 8, "Acidic Residues": 5, "Hydrophobic Residues": 18, "Polar Residues": 31, "Positive Residues": 8, "Negative Residues": 5, "Mass": 5532.36, "PI": 8.3, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": -0.02, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_10675", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "VTCDLLSFKGQVNDSACAANCLSLGKAGGHCEKGVCICRK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_29792", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "VTCDLLSFKGQVNDSACAANCLSLGKAGGHCEKGVCICRK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02613", "Similarity": 0.9803921568627451, "Sequence": "VTCDLLSFKGQVNDSACAANCLSLGKAGGHCEKGVCICRKTSFKDLWDKRF"}]}}}
