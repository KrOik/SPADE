The antimicrobial peptide analogs, according to the present invention, derive from the small octopus and are newly designed to have peptide with superior antimicrobial activity and enable commercialization. Namely, the number of amino acids was suitably designed to enable commercialization and the antimicrobial activity is excellently achieved at both inside and outside of a body, thereby solving a problem of remarkably reduced antimicrobial activity of parent peptide at the outside body of the small octopus. Furthermore, despite a synthesis process by the commercialization, the present invention solved a problem of reduced antimicrobial activity due to a structural change by the synthesis."}, {"Patent No": "KR 20170022961 A", "Patent Link": "http://www.lens.org/lens/patent/KR_20170022961_A", "Patent Type": "Patent Application", "Publication Date": "2017-3-2", "Family Info": "KR101720539B1", "Patent Title": "Antimicrobial peptide analogues Ov1-1, Ov1-2 derived from Octopus variabilis and antimicrobial composition containing the same", "Abstract": "The present invention relates to antimicrobial peptide analogs Ov1-1 and Ov1-2 derived from a small octopus, and to an antimicrobial composition containing the same.
