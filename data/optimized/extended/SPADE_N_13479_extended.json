ALso killed E. coli (99.9% killing at 41.9 ug/ml) and S. aureus (99.9% killing at 11.9 ug/ml) based on virtual colony count assays. This method exposed bacteria to peptides for 2 h in 10 mM phospahtate buffer before incubating in media for 12 h (Wang et al., 2023).Structure: 3 Disulfid bridges: 6, 34; 8, 23; 13, 33.SAR: linearizing the peptide by substituting C with A led to increased activity against E. coli. However, disulfide bonds appear to be important for activity against S. aureus.", "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02891", "Similarity": 0.9714285714285714, "Sequence": "LRDLVCYCRTRGCKRRERMNGTCRKGHLMYTLCCR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07963", "Similarity": 0.9714285714285714, "Sequence": "MKPLVLLSALVLLSFQVQADPIQNTDEETKTEEQSGEEDQAVSVSFGDREGASLQEESLRDLVCYCRTRGCKRRERMNGTCRKGHLMYTLCCR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02909", "Similarity": 0.9705882352941176, "Sequence": "LRDLVCYCRTRGCKRRERMNGTCRKGHLIYTLCC"}]}}}
