The short peptide sequence of SPRLPs were inspired by the repeating PXP motif apparent in longer PRAMPs. We assessed the potential of these SPRLPs to serve as adjuvants in combination with clinically-used antibiotics against P. aeruginosa. Our results revealed an amphiphilic non-hemolytic non-cytotoxic L-lipopeptide lead sequence that strongly potentiates minocycline and rifampicin against MDR/XDR P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, the adjuvant potency is retained in its enantiomeric D-SPRLP counterpart."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_13048", "Sequence": "RKPWIL", "Sequence Length": 6, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 36 from Patent US 10351599", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "IKL", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFGHMNOQSTUVY", "Basic Residues": 2, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 2, "Positive Residues": 2, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 812.01, "PI": 11.0, "Net Charge": 2, "Hydrophobicity": -0.43, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_01087", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RAEAVPPGFTPFRKP"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08067", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MRVLYLLFSFLFIFLMPLPGVFGDIRNPVTCLKSGAICHPVFCPRRYKQIGTCGLPGTKCCRKP"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08069", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MRVLYLLFSFPFIFLMPLPGVFGDIRNPVTCLKSGAICHPVFCPRRYKQIGTCGLPGTKCCRKP"}]}}}
