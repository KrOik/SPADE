This lysine analog is much less hemolytic than the arginine analog (this study) since arginine is more hydrophobic (Mishra et al., 2013). In addition, the peptide is not toxic to human HEK293T and mouse fibroblast cells L929.In vivo toxicity:mouse: 80 mg/kg caused 50% animal death.Animal model:mouse: ip infected S. aureus or A. baumannii, 0.5 hpi, IP treated 20 mg/kg, all mice surviced during 7 days observation (ctr group died in 24 h). Thus, the peptide protected mice from death and also reduced CFU in peritoneal fluids.", "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00932", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KWKSFIKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_24585", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "FIKKIAKLLKKIF"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08367", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KLLK"}]}}}
