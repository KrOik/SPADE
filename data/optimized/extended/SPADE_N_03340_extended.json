In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03340", "Peptide Name": "Corticostatin-6 (Corticostatin VI; Neutrophil antibiotic peptide NP-6; lagomorphs, mammals, anima", "Source": "Oryctolagus cuniculus (Rabbit)", "Family": "Belongs to the alpha-defensin family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "GICACRRRFCLNFEQFSGYCRVNGARYVRCCSRR", "Sequence Length": 34, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P80223", "http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P80224"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C169H269N61O44S6", "Mass": 4051.72, "PI": 9.8, "Net Charge": 7, "Hydrophobicity": -0.34, "Half Life": "Mammalian:30 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Microbicidal activity and inhibits corticotropin (ACTH) stimulated corticosterone production.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Purification and characterization of new anti-adrenocorticotropin Rabbit neutrophil peptides (defensins).", "Pubmed ID": "8397087", "Reference": "Eur J Biochem. 1993 Sep 1;216(2)653-659.", "Author": "Fuse N, Hayashi Y, Fukata J, Tominaga T, Ebisui O, Satoh Y, Isohara T, Uno I, Imura H.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8397087"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RCF", "Absent Amino Acids": "DHKMOPTUW", "Basic Residues": 8, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 11, "Polar Residues": 25, "Positive Residues": 8, "Negative Residues": 1, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02501", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MKTFSVAVAVAVVLTFICLQESSADSVTEVQELEEPMSIGSPVAAYEEMPEESWKMPYASRSSSDRRRRRWRCRTCCRCCPRMKGCGICCRRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03336", "Similarity": 0.9117647058823529, "Sequence": "GICACRRRFCPNSERFSGYCRVNGARYVRCCSRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08054", "Similarity": 0.9117647058823529, "Sequence": "MRTLILLAAILLAALQAQAELFSVNVDEVLDQQQPGSDQDLVIHLTGEESSALQVPDTKGICACRRRFCPNSERFSGYCRVNGARYVRCCSRR"}]}}}
