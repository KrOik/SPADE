This invention pertains more specifically to peptides that are chemically blocked at the amino- and carboxy-termini. In particular the invention relates to peptides comprised of prolylalanine or prolylphenylalanine compounds that have antiviral activity. The invention is specifically directed to methods for preventing infection of human cells in vivo and in vitro with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 and methods for treating human infected with this and other viruses. The invention also relates to the diagnostic and therapeutic use of these antiviral peptide compounds."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_09888", "Sequence": "IKILGNQGSTLTKGPYSK", "Sequence Length": 18, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 8 from Patent US 5447915", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antiviral"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "GKI", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFHMORUVW", "Basic Residues": 3, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 10, "Positive Residues": 3, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 1905.2, "PI": 10.0, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": -0.51, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_24494", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KIKIKIKI"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06544", "Similarity": 0.75, "Sequence": "IKIKIKIKIKIK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06545", "Similarity": 0.75, "Sequence": "IKIRIKIRIKIR"}]}}}
