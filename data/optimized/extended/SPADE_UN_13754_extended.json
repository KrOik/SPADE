The antimicrobial peptide and the antimicrobial peptide composition have remarkably high antibacterial activity against gram-positive (+) and gram-negative (âˆ’) bacteria, compared to wild-type LPcin-I having an antimicrobial ability, which consists of a sequence of 28 amino acids. Also, the antimicrobial peptide can be useful in being easily synthesized and saving production costs since the antimicrobial peptide has a smaller number of amino acids, compared to the wild-type LPcin-I."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_13754", "Sequence": "NKVKEWIKYLKSKFK", "Sequence Length": 15, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 6 from Patent US 10150795", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KEF", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDGHMOPQRTU", "Basic Residues": 6, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 10, "Positive Residues": 6, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 1939.35, "PI": 10.13, "Net Charge": 5, "Hydrophobicity": -1.21, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_09694", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KFKLKSLKIIEYKQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_28377", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KFKLKSLKIIEYKQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_08776", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "SKFKVLRKIIIKEYKGELMLSIQKQR"}]}}}
