Thiazoline or oxazoline rings are dehydrogenated to form thiazole or oxazole rings.  ②Maturation of pyridinyl containing antibiotics involves the cross-linking of a Ser and a Cys-Ser pair usually separated by 7 or 8 residues along the peptide chain. The Ser residues are dehydrated to didehydroalanines, then bonded between their beta carbons. The alpha carbonyl of the Cys condenses with the alpha carbon of the first Ser to form a pyridinyl ring. The ring may be multiply dehydrogenated to form a pyridine ring with loss of the amino nitrogen of the first Ser. ③The diketopiperazine ester in form C may be formed by cyclization and transesterification of the C-terminal dipeptide.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Novel antibiotics, amythiamicins.
