The composition can also include an effective amount of at least one of a growth factor and a neuropeptide. The present invention also relates a method of treating an injury to a nervous system of an animal that includes the steps of identifying the injury to the nervous system and applying to the injury an effective amount of at least one of antimicrobial peptide and a substance having an antimicrobial peptide effect. The method can also include applying an effective amount of one or more trophic factors selected from the group consisting of a growth factor, a neurotrophin, and a neuropeptide to the injury."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_05803", "Sequence": "GKVWDWIKSTAKKLWNSEPVKELKNTALAKNFVAEKIGATPS", "Sequence Length": 42, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 660 from Patent US 7862826", "Source": "Opistophthalmus carinatus", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KAE", "Absent Amino Acids": "CHMOQRUY", "Basic Residues": 8, "Acidic Residues": 4, "Hydrophobic Residues": 19, "Polar Residues": 25, "Positive Residues": 8, "Negative Residues": 4, "Mass": 4685.38, "PI": 9.78, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": -0.53, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03274", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GKVWDWIKSTAKKLWNSEPVKELKNTALNAAKNFVAEKIGATPS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_26323", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GKVWDWIKSTAKKLWN"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03273", "Similarity": 0.9761904761904762, "Sequence": "GKVWDWIKSTAKKLWNSEPVKELKNTALNAAKNLVAEKIGATPS"}]}}}
