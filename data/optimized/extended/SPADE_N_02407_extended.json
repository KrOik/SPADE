In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02407", "Peptide Name": "A.dichotoma defensin (defensins; Insects, animals)", "Source": "Allomyrina dichotoma (Japanese rhinoceros beetle)", "Family": "Belongs to the invertebrate defensin family (Type 1 subfamily)", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "VTCDLLSFEAKGFAANHSLCAAHCLAIGRRGGSCERGVCICRR", "Sequence Length": 43, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q10745"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+"], "Target Organism": "Gram-positive bacteria:Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C189H312N64O55S6", "Mass": 4553.28, "PI": 8.7, "Net Charge": 5, "Hydrophobicity": 0.28, "Half Life": "Mammalian:100 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Comments": "No comments found on DRAMP database", "Literature": [{"Title": "Isolation and characterization of a new member of the insect defensin family from a beetle, Allomyrina dichotoma.", "Pubmed ID": "8607799", "Reference": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996 Mar 27;220(3)526-531.", "Author": "Miyanoshita A, Hara S, Sugiyama M, Asaoka A, Taniai K, Yukuhiro F, Yamakawa M.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8607799"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "ACG", "Absent Amino Acids": "MOPQUWY", "Basic Residues": 8, "Acidic Residues": 3, "Hydrophobic Residues": 16, "Polar Residues": 27, "Positive Residues": 8, "Negative Residues": 3, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00749", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LCAAHCLAIGRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00756", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "AAHCLAIGRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11305", "Similarity": 0.9333333333333333, "Sequence": "LTCDLLSFEAKGFAA"}]}}}
