In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03337", "Peptide Name": "Corticostatin-2 (Antiadrenocorticotropin peptide II; Corticostatin II; lagomorphs, mammals, anima", "Source": "Oryctolagus cuniculus (Rabbit)", "Family": "Belongs to the alpha-defensin family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "GRCVCRKQLLCSYRERRIGDCKIRGVRFPFCCPR", "Sequence Length": 34, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P07468"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Unknown"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C172H289N61O42S6", "Mass": 4075.91, "PI": 9.99, "Net Charge": 8, "Hydrophobicity": -0.45, "Half Life": "Mammalian:30 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Microbicidal activity and inhibits corticotropin (ACTH) stimulated corticosterone production.", "PTM": "Problely contains three disulfide bonds 3-32; 5-21; 11-31.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Primary structures of six antimicrobial peptides of rabbit peritonealneutrophils.", "Pubmed ID": "3988726", "Reference": "J Biol Chem. 1985 Apr 25;260(8)4579-4584.", "Author": "Selsted ME, Brown DM, DeLange RJ, Harwig SS, Lehrer RI.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3988726"}, {"Title": "Isolation and mode of action of rabbit corticostatic (antiadrenocorticotropin) peptides.", "Pubmed ID": "1311240", "Reference": "Endocrinology. 1992 Mar;130(3)1413-1423.", "Author": "Zhu Q, Solomon S.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1311240"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RCG", "Absent Amino Acids": "AHMNOTUW", "Basic Residues": 10, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 11, "Polar Residues": 21, "Positive Residues": 10, "Negative Residues": 2, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_09259", "Similarity": 0.7142857142857143, "Sequence": "GVCRCVCRRGVCRCVCRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_26336", "Similarity": 0.7142857142857143, "Sequence": "RCVCRRGVCRCVCRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_27646", "Similarity": 0.7142857142857143, "Sequence": "GVCRCVCRRGVCRCVCRR"}]}}}
