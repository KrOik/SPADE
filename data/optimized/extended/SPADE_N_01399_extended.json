The composition can also include an effective amount of at least one of a growth factor and a neuropeptide. The present invention also relates a method of treating an injury to a nervous system of an animal that includes the steps of identifying the injury to the nervous system and applying to the injury an effective amount of at least one of antimicrobial peptide and a substance having an antimicrobial peptide effect. The method can also include applying an effective amount of one or more trophic factors selected from the group consisting of a growth factor, a neurotrophin, and a neuropeptide to the injury."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_01399", "Peptide Name": "Rugosin-C (Frogs, amphibians, animals)", "Source": "Glandirana rugosa (Japanese wrinkled frog) (Rana rugosa)", "Family": "Belongs to the frog skin active peptide family (Brevinin subfamily)", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "GILDSFKQFAKGVGKDLIKGAAQGVLSTMSCKLAKTC", "Sequence Length": 37, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P80956"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+"], "Target Organism": "Gram-positive bacterium:Staphylococcus aureus 209P.", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C168H285N45O49S3", "Mass": 3815.53, "PI": 9.51, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": 0.25, "Half Life": "Mammalian:30 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Has antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.", "Tissue specificity": "Expressed by the skin glands.", "PTM": "Contains one disulfide bond 31-37.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Isolation and characterization of novel antimicrobial peptides, rugosins A, B and C, from the skin of the frog, Rana rugosa.", "Pubmed ID": "7612013", "Reference": "Biochem.
