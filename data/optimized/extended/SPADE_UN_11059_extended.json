The inventors developed a novel chimeric peptide targeting cancer cells which overexpress EGFR or the like using a binding peptide such as a peptide sequence binding to EGFR, and a lytic peptide sequence, thereby solving such an object. Particularly, by using a chimeric peptide including an EGF receptor-binding peptide or the like and a cytotoxic peptide, this object was solved."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11059", "Sequence": "WTGWCLNPEESTWGFCTGSF", "Sequence Length": 20, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 55 from Patent US 20110319336", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "GTW", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADHIKMOQRUVY", "Basic Residues": 0, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 7, "Polar Residues": 8, "Positive Residues": 0, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 2308.5, "PI": 4.05, "Net Charge": -2, "Hydrophobicity": -0.27, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00035", "Similarity": 0.6363636363636364, "Sequence": "FKSWSFCTPGCAKTGSFNSYCC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00676", "Similarity": 0.5384615384615384, "Sequence": "ELVLPCKTTYDCVNLPCLGRPPLCINGQCKCTTTLTHQAKLDNLRTMNDAKTCKYTSDCDPRMRYSCVSGSYICLNGFCTCT"}]}}}
