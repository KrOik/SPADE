The present invention relates to novel antimicrobial peptides and derivatives thereof as well as the beta-defensin genes encoding the peptides. The invention further relates to methods of use of the peptides including a method of inhibiting microbial growth by administering an effective amount of the peptide alone or in combination with other antimicrobial agents or antibiotics."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03729", "Sequence": "KSCTAIGGRCKNQCDDSEFRISYCARPTTHCCVT", "Sequence Length": 34, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 59 from Patent US 20030176652", "Source": "Mus musculus", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CTR", "Absent Amino Acids": "LMOUW", "Basic Residues": 6, "Acidic Residues": 3, "Hydrophobic Residues": 8, "Polar Residues": 25, "Positive Residues": 6, "Negative Residues": 3, "Mass": 3755.25, "PI": 8.34, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": -0.48, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02307", "Similarity": 0.5588235294117647, "Sequence": "KMKYPEYGSLDLRRECRMGNGRCKNQCHENEIRIAYCIRPGTHCCLQQ"}]}}}
