The invention further comprises plants incorporating chimeric DNA capable of encoding a protein according to the invention, and wherein the protein is expressed. Also methods are provided for combatting fungi, especially Phytophthora infestans , using a protein or a host cell capable of producing the protein."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_08886", "Sequence": "EDPYRFFERNVTYGTIYPLGVPQQXILINGQF", "Sequence Length": 32, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 1 from Patent US 6291647", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "FGI", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACHKMOSUW", "Basic Residues": 2, "Acidic Residues": 3, "Hydrophobic Residues": 16, "Polar Residues": 14, "Positive Residues": 2, "Negative Residues": 3, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_08890", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "EDPYRFFE"}]}}}
