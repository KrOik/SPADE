The composition can also include an effective amount of at least one of a growth factor and a neuropeptide. The present invention also relates a method of treating an injury to a nervous system of an animal that includes the steps of identifying the injury to the nervous system and applying to the injury an effective amount of at least one of antimicrobial peptide and a substance having an antimicrobial peptide effect. The method can also include applying an effective amount of one or more trophic factors selected from the group consisting of a growth factor, a neurotrophin, and a neuropeptide to the injury."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_01775", "Peptide Name": "Brevinin-1 (Frogs, amphibians, animals)", "Source": "Rana brevipoda porsa (Japanese frog)", "Family": "Belongs to the frog skin active peptide family (Brevinin subfamily)", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "FLPVLAGIAAKVVPALFCKITKKC", "Sequence Length": 24, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P32423"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "[Ref.1449472]Gram-positive bacterium:Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=8 µg/ml);Gram-negative bacterium:Escherichia coli (MIC=34 µg/ml).", "Hemolytic Activity": "[Ref.1449472] high hemolytic activity", "Cytotoxicity": "No cytotoxicity information found in the reference(s) presented", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Cyclic", "N-terminal Modification": "Free", "C-terminal Modification": "Cyclization (Cys18 and Cys24)", "Stereochemistry": "L", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C121H204N28O26S2", "Mass": 2531.22, "PI": 9.7, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": 1.29, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1.1 hourYeast:3 minE.coli:2 min", "Function": "Shows antibacterial activity against representative Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species, and a very high hemolytic activity.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Brevinin-1 and -2, unique antimicrobial peptides from the skin of the frog, Rana brevipoda porsa.", "Pubmed ID": "1449472", "Reference": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1992 Nov 30;189(1)184-190.", "Author": "Morikawa N, Hagiwara K, Nakajima T.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1449472"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "AKL", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEHMNOQRSUWY", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 16, "Polar Residues": 14, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_28513", "Similarity": 0.8, "Sequence": "FLPLLAGLCKITRKCAANFLPKIF"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_01731", "Similarity": 0.7916666666666666, "Sequence": "FLPVIAGLAAKVLPKLFCAITKKC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_22644", "Similarity": 0.7777777777777778, "Sequence": "FLPLIAGLAAKCAITKKC"}]}}}
