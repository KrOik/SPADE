The invention adopts a solid-phase synthesis method to synthesize a drug polypeptide conjugate LND-GFFYKD which covalently connects anticancer drug lonidamine to polypeptide molecules, and adjusts pH to lead the drug polypeptide conjugate to be self-assembled into glue or to be assembled with synergist verapamil to form hydrogel. The hydrogel can improve the solubility of the drug, reduce the toxic and side effects of the drug on the whole body, and has obviously better growth inhibition effect on brain glioma cells than the pure lonidamine drug."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17739", "Sequence": "XGFFYKD", "Sequence Length": 7, "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "FDG", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACEHILMNOPQRSTUVW", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 3, "Polar Residues": 2, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 1, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00559", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "QKRCRQELEPGKQCVLAKCRELCFKQLKGFGSCIEKPPGSSKYTCNCFYNCGPPGFF"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_24103", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "FFPFIGGFFKGFF"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_10898", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "YKDNSY"}]}}}
