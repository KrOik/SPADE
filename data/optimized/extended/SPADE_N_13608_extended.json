Why? Hooper and colleagues found that vitamin A can induce the expression of resistin-like molecule alpha, which has antimicrobial effect. Its expression can protect animals from infection.Host expression: Significantly, a homologous antimicrobial protein is also expressed in humans.See AP3085.", "Similar Sequences": []}}}
