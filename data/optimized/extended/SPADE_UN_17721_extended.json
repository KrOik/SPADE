The CTP of this invention exhibits a transduction potential identical or higher than the conventional protein transduction, PTD, and a strong tendency to remain in the cytoplasm, so that it is very useful in inducing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and a drug delivery system (DDS) targeting cytoplasm."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17721", "Sequence": "YGRRRRRRRRR", "Sequence Length": 11, "Peptide Name": "CTP513", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RGY", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFHIKLMNOPQSTUVW", "Basic Residues": 9, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 1, "Polar Residues": 10, "Positive Residues": 9, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 1643.91, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 9, "Hydrophobicity": -3.84, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00592", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "NCDTYLGEVTVYYPCRERDCEAQCYEHYPHSCKGECEHHDHVVHHDNEEEHCHCYGR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_11979", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RRGFSLKLALAKDGWALMLRLGYGRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_09859", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ISFELLYYGR"}]}}}
