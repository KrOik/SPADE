The novel peptides exhibit broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi by effecting modification of the primary peptide structure. Further, the peptides exhibit improved serum compatibility and reduced hemolysis."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_01384", "Sequence": "KXRRXV", "Sequence Length": 6, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 2 from Patent US 20060128614", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RXK", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFGHILMNOPQSTUWY", "Basic Residues": 3, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 1, "Polar Residues": 4, "Positive Residues": 3, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03537", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "SKCKCSRKGPKIRYSDVKKLEMKPKYPHCEEKMVIITTKSVSRYRGQEHCLHPKLQSTKRFIKWYNAWNEKRRVYEE"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_04934", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RKRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05992", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KRFWQLVPLAIKIYRAWKRR"}]}}}
