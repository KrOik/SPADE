The modified peptide analogues are synthesized by replacing low helical potential amino acid residues with high helical potential residues and modifying the two termini in order to enhance the amphiphilic structures as well as to prolong antimicrobial activity by lowering their susceptibility to protease degradation. For example, low propensity residues within a strategic region of magainin II, e.g. Ser.sup.8, Gly.sup.13 and Gly.sup.18 are modified with Ala which is known to have high propensity. Amidation of Ser.sup.23, and acylation of Gly.sup.1 with acetyl or beta-alanyl and substitution of Gly.sup.1 with beta-alanine are carried out in order to lower the susceptibility to exopeptidase action. A D-Ala modification for disrupting a stretch of the helical structure is also prepared so as to demonstrate the importance of an amphiphilic helic"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_07554", "Sequence": "GIGKFLHSAKKFGKAFVGEIMNSK", "Sequence Length": 24, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 1 from Patent US 5221732", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KGF", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDOPQRTUWY", "Basic Residues": 6, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 10, "Polar Residues": 12, "Positive Residues": 6, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 2595.07, "PI": 10.18, "Net Charge": 5, "Hydrophobicity": -0.08, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02001", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GIGKFLHSAKKFGKAFVGEIMNS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08600", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RAGLQFPVGGIGKFLHSAKKFGK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_09742", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KKKKGIGKFLHSAKKFGKAFVGEIMNS"}]}}}
