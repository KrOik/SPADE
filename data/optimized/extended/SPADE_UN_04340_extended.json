In an exemplified embodiment, a composition of the invention comprises a cecropin-pleurocidin hybrid peptide of 27 amino acids. The peptide was designed based on optimization of critical molecular and physiochemical parameters. Peptides of the invention offer significantly enhanced antimicrobial activity and molecular properties associated with low cytotoxicity. Transgenic plants of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) that express a peptide of the invention show antimicrobial activity against xylem-limited phytopathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiasa at a level significantly higher than that from other existing lytic peptides. Thus, the hybrid peptides of the invention can be utilized as an antimicrobial agent for agricultural use."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_04340", "Sequence": "MALEHM", "Sequence Length": 6, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 5 from Patent US 20100138957", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "MAE", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDFGIKNOPQRSTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 2, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 730.9, "PI": 5.22, "Net Charge": 0, "Hydrophobicity": 0.45, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_11578", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ALWKTMLKKLGTMAL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_11579", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ALFKTMLKKLGTMAL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_11580", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ALYKTMLKKLGTMAL"}]}}}
