The CTP of this invention exhibits a transduction potential identical or higher than the conventional protein transduction, PTD, and a strong tendency to remain in the cytoplasm, so that it is very useful in inducing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and a drug delivery system (DDS) targeting cytoplasm."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17710", "Sequence": "YPRAARRAARR", "Sequence Length": 11, "Peptide Name": "CTP502", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RAP", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEFGHIKLMNOQSTUVW", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 10, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 1343.54, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 5, "Hydrophobicity": -1.65, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00040", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GLAGAISSALDKLKQSQLIKNYAKKLGYPR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00041", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GLAGAISSVLDKLKQSQLIKNYAKKLGYPR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_06673", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ETPKLVYVLILFLSIIFSIIVSNSFPDKIFIGDCKTDKDCKPKRGVNFRCRKGKCYPR"}]}}}
