Bacteriocins are rarely produced by this species (found 2 out of 103 seqd genomes).Chemical modification:  Based on sequence similarity with Lacticin 481, three thioether bonds are proposed: T7-C12, S9-C23, S16-C24. Also, T22 is dehydrated.Sequence analysis: APD analysis reveals that this sequence is similar (84%) toRuminococcin AActivity:  supernatant is active against G+ indicator strains, such as L. cremoris HP. Purified peptide is active against L. cremoris HP (MIC 0.2 uM), S. dysgalactiae GpB (MIC 0.78 uM), S. agalactiae ATCC 13813 (MIC 3.13 uM), C. lituseburense ATCC 25759 (MIC 6.25 uM), and C. perfringens ATCC 362 (MIC 12.5 uM).Antimicrobial robustness:  supernatant remained antimicrobial even after autoclave: perhaps heat-stable, pH-insensitive.Recombinant production:bacteria:B. breve UC2003: this bacteriocin heterologous expression requires all the three modules: pscA, pscM, and pscT.
