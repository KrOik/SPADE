The present inventive methodology is able to allow tuning of a range of structural and functional properties such as pore size and selectively targeting membranes with specific lipid compositions. The present inventive methods will ultimately allow de novo design of membrane-active peptides for a wide range of biomedical applications, including for example, antimicrobial agents."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_01121", "Peptide Name": "Dahlein-1.1 (Frogs, amphibians, animals)", "Source": "Litoria dahlii (Dahl's aquatic frog)", "Family": "Not found", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "GLFDIIKNIVSTL", "Sequence Length": 13, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P84273"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C67H113N15O19", "Mass": 1432.7, "PI": 5.84, "Net Charge": 0, "Hydrophobicity": 1.18, "Half Life": "Mammalian:30 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Weak wide spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.", "Tissue specificity": "Expressed by the skin dorsal glands.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Bioactive dahlein peptides from the skin secretions of the Australian aquatic frog Litoria dahlii sequence determination by electrospray mass spectrometry.", "Pubmed ID": "11555873", "Reference": "Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom. 2001;15(18)1726-1734.", "Author": "Wegener KL, Brinkworth CS, Bowie JH, Wallace JC, Tyler MJ.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11555873"}, {"Title": "Bioactive dahlein peptides from the skin secretions of the Australian aquatic frog Litoria dahlii: sequence determination by electrospray mass spectrometry.", "Pubmed ID": "R2001J0199", "Author": "Tyler M.J.,Wallace J.C.,Bowie J.H.,Brinkworth C.S.,Wegener K.L."}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "ILD", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACEHMOPQRUWY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 7, "Polar Residues": 5, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 1, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11592", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KKKKPLFGLFFGLF"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05505", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "VSTLSVSSPCPGWPSSFTWSNC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_09452", "Similarity": 0.8571428571428571, "Sequence": "GLFDVIK"}]}}}
