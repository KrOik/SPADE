The inventors developed a novel chimeric peptide targeting cancer cells which overexpress EGFR or the like using a binding peptide such as a peptide sequence binding to EGFR, and a lytic peptide sequence, thereby solving such an object. Particularly, by using a chimeric peptide including an EGF receptor-binding peptide or the like and a cytotoxic peptide, this object was solved."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11025", "Sequence": "RLLRRLLRRLLRK", "Sequence Length": 13, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 13 from Patent US 20110319336", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LRK", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFGHIMNOPQSTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 7, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 7, "Positive Residues": 7, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 1762.25, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 7, "Hydrophobicity": -0.62, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_12883", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LLRRLRRLL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_12891", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RLLRRLRRLLR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_13197", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RLLRRLLRRLLR"}]}}}
