Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03991", "Sequence": "GWLKKLGKRIERIGQHTRDATIQGLGIAQQAANVAATARG", "Sequence Length": 40, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 59 from Patent US 20050260715", "Source": "Drosophila melanogaster", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "AGI", "Absent Amino Acids": "CFMOPSUY", "Basic Residues": 8, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 16, "Polar Residues": 24, "Positive Residues": 8, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 4255.84, "PI": 11.57, "Net Charge": 6, "Hydrophobicity": -0.42, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02674", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GWLKKLGKRIERIGQHTRDATIQGLGIAQQAANVAATAR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_04199", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MNFYKIFVFVALILAISIGQSEAGWLKKLGKRIERIGQHTRDATIQGLGIAQQAANVAATARG"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_09878", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "IAQQAANVAATARG"}]}}}
