GRAVY: -0.85; Mol Wt:  7320.535; Mol formula: C323H497N89O89S8. Totally, six N-terminal SPINK9 variants were identified. Variants 1, 2, and 4 with N-terminal Q or K are active.Activity:  Active only against various E. coli in 1% TSB (no TSB, no activity), but not P.aeruginosa NCTC 11440 and ATCC 10145, S.aureus ATCC 6538, S.pyogenes ATCC 12344 or the yeast strain C.albicans ATCC 24433 (data not shown).MOA: Seventeen kilodalton protein (SKP), a chaperone in the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria, is identified as an interacting partner. A SKP KO E. coli strain is more sensitive to killing. The killing activity also depended on the sequence essential for KLK5 inhibition.
