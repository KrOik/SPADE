Development of new AMPs is arduous due to the practical limitations of classical protein-based discovery approaches. A high throughput bioinformatics approach is described which is able to confirm identification of known AMPs from the North American bullfrog ( Rana ( Lithobates ) catesbeiana ) genome, and a bioinformatics approach is used to develop new AMPs. The described AMPs exhibit antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis via microtitre broth dilution assays, indicating broader efficacy."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_13675", "Sequence": "ATAWRIPPPGMQPIIPIRIRPLCGKQ", "Sequence Length": 26, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 47 from Patent US 2022/0125873", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "PIR", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEFHNOSUVY", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 16, "Polar Residues": 10, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 2910.55, "PI": 11.71, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": -0.08, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13676", "Similarity": 0.9230769230769231, "Sequence": "ATAWMIPPRGMQPIIPIRIRPLCGKQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_25198", "Similarity": 0.76, "Sequence": "ATAWKVPPGLQPIRPIRIRPLCGNDKS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_22117", "Similarity": 0.7, "Sequence": "IRIRPIRIRP"}]}}}
