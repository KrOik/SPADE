Development of new AMPs is arduous due to the practical limitations of classical protein-based discovery approaches. A high throughput bioinformatics approach is described which is able to confirm identification of known AMPs from the North American bullfrog ( Rana ( Lithobates ) catesbeiana ) genome, and a bioinformatics approach is used to develop new AMPs. The described AMPs exhibit antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis via microtitre broth dilution assays, indicating broader efficacy."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_13682", "Sequence": "ALVAKIQKFPVFNTLKLCKLELEII", "Sequence Length": 25, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 54 from Patent US 2022/0125873", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LKI", "Absent Amino Acids": "DGHMORSUWY", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 15, "Polar Residues": 12, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 2872.55, "PI": 9.12, "Net Charge": 2, "Hydrophobicity": 0.83, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13683", "Similarity": 0.92, "Sequence": "ALVAKIQKFPVFNTLKLCKLKLRII"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13686", "Similarity": 0.75, "Sequence": "IQRLPVINMLKLWKLELEII"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_24740", "Similarity": 0.6666666666666666, "Sequence": "LKLKLKLKL"}]}}}
