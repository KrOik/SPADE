Three peptides were synthesized with sequences corresponding to amino acids 65-99 (bBPI65-99), 142-169 (bBPI142-169), or the combination of amino acids 90-99 and 148-161 (bBPI90-99,148-161) of bBPI. The bBPI90-99,148-161 peptide demonstrated the widest spectrum of antimicrobial activity, with minimum inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) concentration values ranging from 16-64 µg/ml against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp, and 64-128 µg/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. None of the peptides exhibited any growth inhibitory effect on Serratia marcescens. The antimicrobial activity of bBPI90-99,148-161 was inhibited in milk, but preserved in serum. Finally, both bBPI142-169 and bBPI90-99,148-161 were demonstrated to completely neutralize LPS. The peptide bBPI90-99,148-161 is a potent neutrali"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_04225", "Sequence": "MCHWAGGASNTGDARGDVFGKQAG", "Sequence Length": 24, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 5 from Patent US 20090048160", "Source": "Bos sp.", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "GAD", "Absent Amino Acids": "EILOPUY", "Basic Residues": 3, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 8, "Polar Residues": 13, "Positive Residues": 3, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 2393.57, "PI": 6.5, "Net Charge": 1, "Hydrophobicity": -0.49, "Similar Sequences": []}}}
