In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02411", "Peptide Name": "Defensin (Type 1 invertebrate defensin; Insects, animals)", "Source": "Pyrrhocoris apterus (Sap sucking bug)", "Family": "Belongs to the invertebrate defensin family (Type 1 subfamily)", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "ATCDILSFQSQWVTPNHAGCALHCVIKGYKGGQCKITVCHCRR", "Sequence Length": 43, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P37364", "http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P80308"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+"], "Target Organism": "Gram-positive bacteria:Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus megaterium, Aerococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Bacillus subtilis QB935, Escherichia coli D22.", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C203H323N63O56S6", "Mass": 4734.51, "PI": 8.92, "Net Charge": 7, "Hydrophobicity": -0.0, "Half Life": "Mammalian:4.4 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Has antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and the Gram-negative bacterium E.coli D22.", "PTM": "Contains three disulfide bonds 3-34; 20-39; 24-41 (By similarity).", "Literature": [{"Title": "Novel inducible antibacterial peptides from a hemipteran insect, the sap-sucking bug Pyrrhocoris apterus.", "Pubmed ID": "8002963", "Reference": "Biochem J. 1994 Jun 1;300 (Pt 2)567-575.", "Author": "Cociancich S, Dupont A, Hegy G, Lanot R, Holder F, Hetru C, Hoffmann JA, Bulet P.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8002963"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CGA", "Absent Amino Acids": "EMOU", "Basic Residues": 8, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 15, "Polar Residues": 30, "Positive Residues": 8, "Negative Residues": 1, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_09004", "Similarity": 0.7647058823529411, "Sequence": "WVIKGYKGGQKITVHRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_27237", "Similarity": 0.7647058823529411, "Sequence": "WVIKGYKGGQKITVHRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_13754", "Similarity": 0.7441860465116279, "Sequence": "ATCDALSFQSKWITINHSACAIHCIAKGYKGGQCKNTVCHCRK"}]}}}
