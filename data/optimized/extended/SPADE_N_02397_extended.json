In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02397", "Peptide Name": "Coleoptericin (Insects, animals)", "Source": "Zophobas atratus (Giant mealworm beetle)", "Family": "Belongs to the coleoptericin family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "SLQGGAPNFPQPSQQNGGWQVSPDLGRDDKGNTRGQIEIQNKGKDHDFNAGWGKVIRGPNKAKPTWHVGGTYRR", "Sequence Length": 74, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P80032"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "Gram-negative bacteria:Escherichia coli D31, E. coli D22 (highly activity), Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas maltophilia (lower activity);Gram-positive bacterium:Micrococcus luteus.", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C353H543N115O107", "Mass": 8109.79, "PI": 10.11, "Net Charge": 7, "Hydrophobicity": -1.32, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1.9 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Responsible for the anti Gram-negative activity of immune hemolymph of Z. atratus.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Insect immunity.
