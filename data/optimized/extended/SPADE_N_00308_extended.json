DNA encoding the proteins may be isolated and incorporated into vectors. Plants transformed with this DNA may be produced. The proteins find commercial application as antifungal or antibacterial agents; transformed plants will show increased disease resistance."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_00308", "Peptide Name": "Non-specific lipid-transfer protein A (NS-LTP A; PLTP; Plants)", "Source": "Ricinus communis (Castor bean)", "Family": "Belongs to the plant LTP family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "VDCGQVNSSLASCIPFLTGGVASPSASCCAGVQNLKTLAPTSADRRAACECIKAAAARFPTIKQDAASSLPKKCGVDINIPISKTTNCQAIN", "Sequence Length": 92, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P10973"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Unknown"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Lipid-binding", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C393H658N116O128S8", "Mass": 9312.65, "PI": 8.72, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": 0.16, "Half Life": "Mammalian:100 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Plant non-specific lipid-transfer proteins transfer phospholipids as well as galactolipids across membranes.
