Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03986", "Sequence": "EAELEAEP", "Sequence Length": 8, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 32 from Patent US 20050260715", "Source": "Apis mellifera", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "EAL", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDFGHIKMNOQRSTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 0, "Acidic Residues": 4, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 2, "Positive Residues": 0, "Negative Residues": 4, "Mass": 886.9, "PI": 4.05, "Net Charge": -4, "Hydrophobicity": -1.02, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03988", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "EAEP"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05042", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LAMPFATPMEAEL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05044", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MPFATPMEAEL"}]}}}
