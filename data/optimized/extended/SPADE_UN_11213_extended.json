In particular, the peptide molecules exhibit a high antimicrobial activity against numerous bacterial species, with reduced cytotoxicity and a low haemolysis rate. The molecules of the invention are advantageously usable as therapeutic agents and coadjutants against infections caused by strains that are resistant to common antibiotics."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11213", "Sequence": "QRRIRVRLSA", "Sequence Length": 10, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 15 from Patent US 20090053151", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RAI", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEFGHKMNOPTUWY", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 8, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 1254.49, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": -0.8, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06881", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RKKRRQRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00150", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GPIPWQRRI"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_02395", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LNKFVKQRR"}]}}}
