The peptides of the present invention selected two peptides (PD-L1Pep-1 and PD-L1Pep-2) that bind well to cells with high expression of human PD-L1 protein using phage peptide display technology and it was confirmed that it inhibits its function by binding to PD-L1 in humans and mice. The peptide of the present invention showed an effect similar level to that of an antibody and is relatively stable in blood, indicating a high potential as a cancer immunotherapy in the future."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_15689", "Sequence": "CLQKTPKQC", "Sequence Length": 9, "Peptide Name": "PBP-1", "Source": "Not available", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CKQ", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADEFGHIMNORSUVWY", "Basic Residues": 2, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 2, "Polar Residues": 7, "Positive Residues": 2, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 1048.28, "PI": 8.9, "Net Charge": 2, "Hydrophobicity": -0.92, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03711", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LRCMGNSGICRASCKKNEQPYLYCRNCQSCCLQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03712", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LQCMGNRGFCRSSCKKSEQAYFYCRTFQMCCLQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03727", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RECRIGNGQCKNQCHENEIRIAYCIRPGTHCCLQ"}]}}}
