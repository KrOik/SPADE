It contains 4 thioether rings and one S-S bond. The sequence of Chain RosA2  is GSGVLGTLGCCSCLPWYSGWTVCGLACNPGKPCKN containing 6 thioether rings, more than other beta chain. This is the first two-chain lantibiotic from a non-Firmicute.Toxicity:  Inhibition zone: A single chain is inactive but becomes active when combined against Gram+ bacteria.
