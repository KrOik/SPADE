Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02463", "Peptide Name": "Cathelicidin-3 (Bactenecin-7, Bac7; PR-59; mammals, animals)", "Source": "Bos taurus (Bovine)", "Family": "Belongs to the cathelicidin family", "Gene": "CATHL3", "Sequence": "RRIRPRPPRLPRPRPRPLPFPRPGPRPIPRPLPFPRPGPRPIPRPLPFPRPGPRPIPRP", "Sequence Length": 59, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P19661", "http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/A5PJ95"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "Gram-negative bacterium:Escherichia coli.", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C323H526N110O60", "Mass": 6910.33, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 17, "Hydrophobicity": -1.37, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1 hourYeast:2 minE.coli:2 min", "Function": "Exerts, in vitro, a potent antimicrobial activity.
