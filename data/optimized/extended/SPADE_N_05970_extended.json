The present inventive methodology is able to allow tuning of a range of structural and functional properties such as pore size and selectively targeting membranes with specific lipid compositions. The present inventive methods will ultimately allow de novo design of membrane-active peptides for a wide range of biomedical applications, including for example, antimicrobial agents."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_05970", "Sequence": "GIGAVLKVL", "Sequence Length": 9, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 23 from Patent WO", "Source": "Apis mellifera", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "GLV", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEFHMNOPQRSTUWY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 4, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 869.1, "PI": 8.75, "Net Charge": 1, "Hydrophobicity": 1.96, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02602", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISWIKRKRQQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_04203", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISWISRKKRQQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06727", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KIAKVALAKLGIGAVLKVLTTGL"}]}}}
