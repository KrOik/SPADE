The inventors developed a novel chimeric peptide targeting cancer cells which overexpress EGFR or the like using a binding peptide such as a peptide sequence binding to EGFR, and a lytic peptide sequence, thereby solving such an object. Particularly, by using a chimeric peptide including an EGF receptor-binding peptide or the like and a cytotoxic peptide, this object was solved."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11021", "Sequence": "YRWYGYTPQNVI", "Sequence Length": 12, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 9 from Patent US 20110319336", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "YGI", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFHKLMOSU", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 7, "Polar Residues": 8, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 1559.72, "PI": 8.5, "Net Charge": 1, "Hydrophobicity": -0.86, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11026", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "YRWYGYTPQNVIGGGKLLLKLLKKLLKLLKKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_15706", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "YRWYGYTPQNVIGGGKLLLKLLKKLLKLLKKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11018", "Similarity": 0.9166666666666666, "Sequence": "YHWYGYTPQNVIGGGKLLLKLLKKLLKLLKKK"}]}}}
