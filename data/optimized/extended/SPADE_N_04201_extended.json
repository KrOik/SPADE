In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_04201", "Sequence": "GGRLCYCRRRFCICVG", "Sequence Length": 16, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 18 from Patent US 20080269122", "Source": "Sus scrofa", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CRG", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADEHKMNOPQSTUW", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 5, "Polar Residues": 10, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 1862.28, "PI": 9.37, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": 0.3, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02571", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RGGRLCYCRRRFCICV"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07318", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "VSRRRRRRGGRRRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_11055", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KNKRKRRRRRRGGRRRR"}]}}}
