In particular, the invention relates to immunotherapy of cancer. The invention also relates to tumor-associated T Cell (CTL) peptide epitopes, used alone or in combination with other tumor-associated peptides that stimulate an anti-tumor immune response or stimulate T cells in vitro and the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the vaccine composition transferred into the patient. Peptides that bind to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules or peptides of the same may also be targets for antibodies, soluble T cell receptors and other binding molecules."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_18321", "Sequence": "ATDIPCLLY", "Sequence Length": 9, "Peptide Name": "SEQ ID NO: 399 of Patent CN110785183A", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LAC", "Absent Amino Acids": "EFGHKMNOQRSUVW", "Basic Residues": 0, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 4, "Positive Residues": 0, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 1008.19, "PI": 4.05, "Net Charge": -1, "Hydrophobicity": 1.03, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17293", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "CLLYWFRRRHRHHRRRHRRC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_02738", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LLYWKRGIY"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17295", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LLYWFRRRHRHHRRRHRR"}]}}}
