Antimicrobial properties include bacteriostasis, which is related to its ability to sequester free iron and thus inhibit microbial growth, as well as direct bactericidal properties leading to the release of lipopolysaccharides from the bacterial outer membrane. Can also prevent bacterial biofilm development in P.aeruginosa infection. Has weak antifungal activity against C.albicans.
