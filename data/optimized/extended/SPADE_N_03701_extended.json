The present invention relates to novel antimicrobial peptides and derivatives thereof as well as the beta-defensin genes encoding the peptides. The invention further relates to methods of use of the peptides including a method of inhibiting microbial growth by administering an effective amount of the peptide alone or in combination with other antimicrobial agents or antibiotics."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03701", "Sequence": "QDCSKHRHCRMKCKANEYAVRYCEDWTICCRV", "Sequence Length": 32, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 27 from Patent US 20030176652", "Source": "Mus musculus", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CRK", "Absent Amino Acids": "FGLOPU", "Basic Residues": 9, "Acidic Residues": 4, "Hydrophobic Residues": 9, "Polar Residues": 25, "Positive Residues": 9, "Negative Residues": 4, "Mass": 3936.55, "PI": 8.65, "Net Charge": 5, "Hydrophobicity": -0.9, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02958", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "FLENQDCSKHRHCRMKCKANEYAVRYCEDWTICCRVKKKESKKKKMW"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03014", "Similarity": 0.84375, "Sequence": "FLANQECFSEYRHCRMKCKANEYAIRYCADWTICCRVKKREAKKKIMW"}]}}}
