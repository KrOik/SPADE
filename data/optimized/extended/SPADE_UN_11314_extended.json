The present invention further concerns the use of such agents for the treatment of bacterial infections in animals, including man. The agents are derivatives of vancomycin-type antibiotics, of structure: V-L-W-X; wherein V is a glycopeptide moiety which inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis in bacteria; L is a linking group; W is a peptidic membrane-associating element such as an element based on naturally-occurring animal or bacterial peptide antibiotics; and X is hydrogen or a membrane-insertive element."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11314", "Sequence": "GIGKFLHSAGKFGKAFVGEIMK", "Sequence Length": 22, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 9 from Patent US 7078380", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "GKF", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDNOPQRTUWY", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 10, "Polar Residues": 9, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 2322.77, "PI": 10.0, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": 0.26, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02000", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GIGKFLHSAGKFGKAFVGEIMKS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_10970", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KWKLFKKIGIGKFL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_10971", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KKKKWKLFKKIGIGKFL"}]}}}
