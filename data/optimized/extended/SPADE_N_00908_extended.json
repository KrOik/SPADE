Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_00908", "Peptide Name": "Leaf-specific thionin BTH6 (Plant defensin)", "Source": "Hordeum vulgare (Barley)", "Family": "Belongs to the thionin family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "KSCCKDTLARNCYNTCRFAGGSRPVCAGACRCKIISGPKCPSDYPK", "Sequence Length": 46, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P09618"], "Protein Existence": "Transcript level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antifungal"], "Target Organism": "Fungi:Thievaliopsis paradoxa, Drechslera teres.", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C204H335N65O61S8", "Mass": 4930.76, "PI": 9.22, "Net Charge": 7, "Hydrophobicity": -0.43, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1.3 hourYeast:3 minE.coli:2 min", "Function": "Thionins are small plant proteins which are toxic to animal cells.
