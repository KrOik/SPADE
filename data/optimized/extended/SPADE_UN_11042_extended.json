The inventors developed a novel chimeric peptide targeting cancer cells which overexpress EGFR or the like using a binding peptide such as a peptide sequence binding to EGFR, and a lytic peptide sequence, thereby solving such an object. Particularly, by using a chimeric peptide including an EGF receptor-binding peptide or the like and a cytotoxic peptide, this object was solved."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11042", "Sequence": "GGNECDAIRMWEWECFERL", "Sequence Length": 19, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 33 from Patent US 20110319336", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "ECG", "Absent Amino Acids": "HKOPQSTUVY", "Basic Residues": 2, "Acidic Residues": 5, "Hydrophobic Residues": 7, "Polar Residues": 6, "Positive Residues": 2, "Negative Residues": 5, "Mass": 2344.6, "PI": 4.25, "Net Charge": -3, "Hydrophobicity": -0.67, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11041", "Similarity": 0.631578947368421, "Sequence": "VEPNCDIHVMWEWECFERL"}]}}}
