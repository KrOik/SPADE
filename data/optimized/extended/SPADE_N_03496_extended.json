The antimicrobial peptide of the present invention shows excellent antimicrobial activity under strong acidic and basic environments. Moreover, it also shows strong antimicrobial activity against resistant bacteria. So, it can be used usefully as a natural antimicrobial agent."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03496", "Peptide Name": "17Hc", "Source": "Halocynthia aurantium", "Family": "Not found", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "WLNALLHHGLNCAKGVL", "Sequence Length": 17, "UniProt Entry": "No entry found", "Protein Existence": "Not found", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C85H135N25O20S", "Mass": 1859.2, "PI": 8.24, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": 0.61, "Half Life": "Mammalian:2.8 hourYeast:3 minE.coli:2 min", "Comments": "No comments found on DRAMP database", "Literature": [{"Title": "Biological Activities of Synthetic Analogs of Halocidin, an Antimicrobial Peptide from the Tunicate Halocynthia aurantium.", "Pubmed ID": "12878508", "Reference": "Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2003 Aug;47(8)2481-2486.", "Author": "Jang WS, Kim CH, Kim KN, Park SY, Lee JH, Son SM, Lee IH.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12878508"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LAG", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEFIMOPQRSTUY", "Basic Residues": 3, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 9, "Polar Residues": 9, "Positive Residues": 3, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02747", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "WLNALLHHGLNCAKGVLA"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03498", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KWLNALLHHGLNCAKGVLA"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_04126", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "WLNALLHHGLNCAKG"}]}}}
