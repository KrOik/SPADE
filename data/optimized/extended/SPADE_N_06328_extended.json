The inventors developed a novel chimeric peptide targeting cancer cells which overexpress EGFR or the like using a binding peptide such as a peptide sequence binding to EGFR, and a lytic peptide sequence, thereby solving such an object. Particularly, by using a chimeric peptide including an EGF receptor-binding peptide or the like and a cytotoxic peptide, this object was solved."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_06328", "Sequence": "KQLIRFLKRLDRNGGGKLLLKLLKKLLKLLKKK", "Sequence Length": 33, "Peptide Name": "IL-4RÎ±-lytic peptide", "Source": "Interleukin-4 receptor a", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LKG", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACEHMOPSTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 13, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 14, "Polar Residues": 15, "Positive Residues": 13, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 3914.99, "PI": 11.8, "Net Charge": 12, "Hydrophobicity": -0.34, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11030", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KQLIRFLKRLDRNGGGKLLLKLLKKLLKLLKKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11036", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KQLIRFLKRLDRN"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06022", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KLLLKLLKKLL"}]}}}
