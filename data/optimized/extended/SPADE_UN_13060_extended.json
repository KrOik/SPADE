The present inventive methodology is able to allow tuning of a range of structural and functional properties such as pore size and selectively targeting membranes with specific lipid compositions. The present inventive methods will ultimately allow de novo design of membrane-active peptides for a wide range of biomedical applications, including for example, antimicrobial agents."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_13060", "Sequence": "GLADLAKLLLKLLGW", "Sequence Length": 15, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 5 from Patent WO", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LAG", "Absent Amino Acids": "CEFHIMNOPQRSTUVY", "Basic Residues": 2, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 10, "Polar Residues": 4, "Positive Residues": 2, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 1624.02, "PI": 8.59, "Net Charge": 1, "Hydrophobicity": 1.15, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06462", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GIGSAILSAGKSIIKGLAKGLA"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_23774", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KLLLKLL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_23741", "Similarity": 0.8888888888888888, "Sequence": "LLKLLLKLL"}]}}}
