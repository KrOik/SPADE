The composition can also include an effective amount of at least one of a growth factor and a neuropeptide. The present invention also relates a method of treating an injury to a nervous system of an animal that includes the steps of identifying the injury to the nervous system and applying to the injury an effective amount of at least one of antimicrobial peptide and a substance having an antimicrobial peptide effect. The method can also include applying an effective amount of one or more trophic factors selected from the group consisting of a growth factor, a neurotrophin, and a neuropeptide to the injury."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_01976", "Peptide Name": "Ranatuerin-1T (Brevinin-2T; Frogs, amphibians, animals)", "Source": "Rana temporaria (European common frog)", "Family": "Belongs to the frog skin active peptide family (Brevinin subfamily)", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "GLLSGLKKVGKHVAKNVAVSLMDSLKCKISGDC", "Sequence Length": 33, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P82740", "http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P82236"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "Gram-negative bacterium:Escherichia coli;Gram-positive bacterium:Staphylococcus aureus.", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C147H260N42O43S3", "Mass": 3400.09, "PI": 9.51, "Net Charge": 5, "Hydrophobicity": 0.27, "Half Life": "Mammalian:30 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Comments": "No comments found on DRAMP database", "Literature": [{"Title": "Ranatuerin 1T an antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin of the frog, Rana temporaria.", "Pubmed ID": "10422869", "Reference": "Peptides. 1999;20(2)159-163.", "Author": "Goraya J, Knoop FC, Conlon JM.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10422869"}, {"Title": "Antimicrobial peptides from amphibian skin what do they tell us?", "Pubmed ID": "10333736", "Reference": "Biopolymers. 1998;47(6)435-450.", "Author": "Simmaco M, Mignogna G, Barra D.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10333736"}, {"Title": "Antimicrobial peptides from amphibian skin: what do they tell us?", "Pubmed ID": "", "Author": "Barra D.,Mignogna G.,Simmaco M."}, {"Title": "Ranatuerin 1T: an antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin of the frog, Rana temporaria.", "Pubmed ID": "", "Author": "Conlon J.M.,Knoop F.C.,Goraya J."}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KLG", "Absent Amino Acids": "EFOPQRTUWY", "Basic Residues": 7, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 20, "Positive Residues": 7, "Negative Residues": 2, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_15921", "Similarity": 0.7575757575757576, "Sequence": "GLLSVFKGVLKTAGKNVAKNVAGSLLDQLKCKISGGC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_16933", "Similarity": 0.7575757575757576, "Sequence": "GLLSVFKGVLKTAGKNVAKNVAGSLLDQLKCKISGGC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_14792", "Similarity": 0.7272727272727273, "Sequence": "GLFSAFKKVGKNVLKNVAGSLMDNLKCKVSGEC"}]}}}
