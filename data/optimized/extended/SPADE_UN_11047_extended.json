The inventors developed a novel chimeric peptide targeting cancer cells which overexpress EGFR or the like using a binding peptide such as a peptide sequence binding to EGFR, and a lytic peptide sequence, thereby solving such an object. Particularly, by using a chimeric peptide including an EGF receptor-binding peptide or the like and a cytotoxic peptide, this object was solved."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11047", "Sequence": "SNEW", "Sequence Length": 4, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 38 from Patent US 20110319336", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "ENS", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDFGHIKLMOPQRTUVY", "Basic Residues": 0, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 1, "Polar Residues": 2, "Positive Residues": 0, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 534.52, "PI": 4.05, "Net Charge": -1, "Hydrophobicity": -2.17, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_26701", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "NEWKKIKKIIKIVK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00243", "Similarity": 0.75, "Sequence": "RVCMGKSQHHSFPCISDRLCSNECVKEEGGWTAGYCHLRYCRCQKAC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00453", "Similarity": 0.75, "Sequence": "AEIKKFSYDHCFHLCVAGEYGSNECFVDCAQKGFWHGDCANRTEKDPIRCCCYN"}]}}}
