The invention further relates to oligomers of these peptides consisting of at least two such peptides which are coupled to each other, optionally via a spacer, for use as antiviral agent, in addition to the use of the peptides and/or oligomers for the manufacture of a medicine for treating viral infections."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_00674", "Peptide Name": "Dhvar4", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Family": "Not found", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "KRLFKKLLFSLRKY", "Sequence Length": 14, "UniProt Entry": "No entry found", "Protein Existence": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C90H150N24O17", "Mass": 1840.3, "PI": 11.22, "Net Charge": 6, "Hydrophobicity": -0.42, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1.3 hourYeast:3 minE.coli:2 min", "Comments": "No comments found on DRAMP database", "Literature": [{"Title": "Cationic amphipathic peptides, derived from bovine and human lactoferrins, with antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens.", "Pubmed ID": "10518718", "Reference": "FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1999 Oct 15;179(2)217-222.", "Author": "Groenink J, Walgreen-Weterings E, van 't Hof W, Veerman EC, Nieuw Amerongen AV.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10518718"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KLF", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEGHIMNOPQTUVW", "Basic Residues": 6, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 7, "Polar Residues": 8, "Positive Residues": 6, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02048", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "FIGGIISFFKRLF"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02089", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "IGGIISFFKRLF"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08489", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KRLFKKLLKFSLRKY"}]}}}
