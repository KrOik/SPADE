The invention also provides specific analogs or fragments of cathelicidin that function as agonists, as do endogenous cathelicidins, or as either dominant negatives or as inhibitors to endogenous cathelicidin or to other endogenous AMPs or that compete with pro-inflammatory agents or fragments of AMPs on cognate receptors without inducing disease."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03526", "Peptide Name": "ECATH-2", "Source": "Equus asinus", "Family": "Not found", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "KRRHWFPLSFQEFLEQLRRFRDQLPFP", "Sequence Length": 27, "UniProt Entry": "No entry found", "Protein Existence": "Not found", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C169H249N49O38", "Mass": 3575.09, "PI": 11.42, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": -1.03, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1.3 hourYeast:3 minE.coli:2 min", "Comments": "No comments found on DRAMP database", "Literature": [{"Title": "Novel cathelicidins in horse leukocytes(1).", "Pubmed ID": "10471829", "Reference": "FEBS Lett. 1999 Sep 3;457(3)459-464.", "Author": "Scocchi M, Bontempo D, Boscolo S, Tomasinsig L, Giulotto E, Zanetti M.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10471829"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "FRL", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACGIMNOTUVY", "Basic Residues": 7, "Acidic Residues": 3, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 11, "Positive Residues": 7, "Negative Residues": 3, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_16317", "Similarity": 0.7, "Sequence": "RFRRFRLPFRRIHPPPFVRIHPPPFYRRFL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_22916", "Similarity": 0.5, "Sequence": "RFRRFRRFRRFR"}]}}}
