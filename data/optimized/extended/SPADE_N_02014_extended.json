The composition can also include an effective amount of at least one of a growth factor and a neuropeptide. The present invention also relates a method of treating an injury to a nervous system of an animal that includes the steps of identifying the injury to the nervous system and applying to the injury an effective amount of at least one of antimicrobial peptide and a substance having an antimicrobial peptide effect. The method can also include applying an effective amount of one or more trophic factors selected from the group consisting of a growth factor, a neurotrophin, and a neuropeptide to the injury."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02014", "Peptide Name": "Pseudin-1 (Pseudin 1; Frogs, amphibians, animals)", "Source": "Pseudis paradoxa (Paradoxical frog)", "Family": "Not found", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "GLNTLKKVFQGLHEAIKLINNHVQ", "Sequence Length": 24, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P83188"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-", "Antifungal"], "Target Organism": "Gram-negative bacterium:Escherichia coli;Gram-positive bacterium:Staphylococcus aureus.Yeast:Candida albicans.", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C123H204N36O33", "Mass": 2715.16, "PI": 9.7, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": -0.14, "Half Life": "Mammalian:30 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Possesses antifungal activity against C. albicans and is also active against E. coli and S. aureus.", "Tissue specificity": "Expressed by the skin glands.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Pseudin-2 an antimicrobial peptide with low hemolytic activity from the skin of the paradoxical frog.", "Pubmed ID": "11689009", "Reference": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 Nov 9;288(4)1001-1005.", "Author": "Olson L 3rd, Soto AM, Knoop FC, Conlon JM.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11689009"}, {"Title": "Pseudin-2: an antimicrobial peptide with low hemolytic activity from the skin of the paradoxical frog.", "Pubmed ID": "", "Author": "Conlon J.M.,Knoop F.C.,Soto A.M.,Olson L.
