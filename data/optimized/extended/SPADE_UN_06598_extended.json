Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the peptides as active ingredients are also provided for wound healing and skin rejuvenation. The antimicrobial peptides exhibit inhibitory activity against antibiotic-resistant strains, and their antimicrobial activity is maintained without loss of structural stability even under a high salt condition. Also, being proven to promote the migration and regeneration of skin cells in mice as well as in vitro, the antimicrobial peptides may be widely used as an agent for regenerating skin cells. Further, they can find applications in various fields including the medical industry and the cosmetic industry. Hence, the novel antimicrobial peptides are anticipated to have considerable repercussions in the market for antibiotics, wound healing agents and cosmetics."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_06598", "Sequence": "APKAMXXXXXXXXLQKKGI", "Sequence Length": 19, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 3 from Patent US 20120088733", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "XKA", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEFHNORSTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 3, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 6, "Positive Residues": 3, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03083", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ETESTPDYLKNIQQQLEEYTKNFNTQVQNAFDSDKIKSEVNNFIESLGKILNTEKKEAPK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_06596", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "APKAMKLLKKLLKLQKKGI"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_06597", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "APKAMRLLRRLLRLQKKGI"}]}}}
