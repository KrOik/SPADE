Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03992", "Sequence": "ZFTNVSCTTSKECWSVCQRLHNTSRGKCMNKKCRCYS", "Sequence Length": 37, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 62 from Patent US 20050260715", "Source": "Leiurus quin-questriatus", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CSK", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADIOPU", "Basic Residues": 8, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 7, "Polar Residues": 30, "Positive Residues": 8, "Negative Residues": 1, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03293", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "QFTNVSCTTSKECWSVCQRLHNTSRGKCMNKKCRCYS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05748", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "EFTNVSCTTSKECWSVCQRLHNTSRGKCMNKKCRCYS"}]}}}
