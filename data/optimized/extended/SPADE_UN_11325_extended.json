The present invention further concerns the use of such agents for the treatment of bacterial infections in animals, including man. The agents are derivatives of vancomycin-type antibiotics, of structure: V-L-W-X; wherein V is a glycopeptide moiety which inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis in bacteria; L is a linking group; W is a peptidic membrane-associating element such as an element based on naturally-occurring animal or bacterial peptide antibiotics; and X is hydrogen or a membrane-insertive element."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11325", "Sequence": "GGKFIHSAKKFGKAFVGEIMNS", "Sequence Length": 22, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 36 from Patent US 7078380", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "GKF", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDLOPQRTUWY", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 9, "Polar Residues": 11, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 2353.74, "PI": 10.0, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": -0.09, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05753", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "AKKFGKAFVGEIM"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_21665", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "AKKFGKAFV"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_30846", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "AKKFGKAFVGEIM"}]}}}
