Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03993", "Sequence": "ALWKTMLKKLGTMALHAGKAALGAADTISQTQ", "Sequence Length": 32, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 82 from Patent US 20050260715", "Source": "Phyllomedusa sauvagii", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "ALK", "Absent Amino Acids": "CEFNOPRUVY", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 16, "Polar Residues": 19, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 3326.93, "PI": 10.0, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": 0.15, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_11578", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ALWKTMLKKLGTMAL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_11582", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KALWKTMLKKLGTMAL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00914", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ALWKTMLKKLGTMALHAGKAALGAAADTISQTQ"}]}}}
