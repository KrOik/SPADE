Mol. Wt:  4255.156; GRAVY: -0.79; Mol Formula: C169H295N67O45S8; mol ex coeff: 1865.Activity: killed 99.9% E. coli (4.6 ug/ml) and S. aureus (5.5 ug/ml) based on virtual colony count assays. This method exposed bacteria to peptides for 2 h in 10 mM phospahtate buffer before incubating in media for 12 h.Structure: 3D structure of this defensin has been determined. Crp14 is dimeric in the crystal obtained at 14 mg/ml pH 4.6. This structure is proposed to exisit in vivo where the peptide concentration could reach 15 to 100 mg/ml (Ayabe et al., 2000).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. Note that at 10 uM at pH 7.4, crp14 is a monomer.SAR: replacing 6 cys with Ala led to linear crp14. It shows similar antibacterial activity to crp14. However, the linear form appeared to be less effective than the WT to complete inhibit the bacteria at higher concentrations, indicating the importance of S-S bonds.", "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02902", "Similarity": 0.9714285714285714, "Sequence": "LRDLVCYCRTRGCKRRERMNGTCRKGHLMHTLCCR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07840", "Similarity": 0.9714285714285714, "Sequence": "ALVLLAFQVQADPIQNTDEETKTEEQPGEDDQAVSVSFGDPEGSSLQEESLRDLVCYCRTRGCKRRERMNGTCRKGHLMHTLCCR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02891", "Similarity": 0.9428571428571428, "Sequence": "LRDLVCYCRTRGCKRRERMNGTCRKGHLMYTLCCR"}]}}}
