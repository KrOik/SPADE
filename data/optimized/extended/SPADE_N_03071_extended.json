The hybrid peptides of the present invention are easily synthesized and have reduced toxicity. Also included in the invention are pharmaceutical compositions containing such hybrid peptides, and methods of treating patients infected with an organism against which these peptides are active."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03071", "Peptide Name": "Cecropin-B (Immune protein P9; Insects, animals)", "Source": "Hyalophora cecropia (Cecropia moth)", "Family": "Belongs to the cecropin family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "KWKVFKKIEKMGRNIRNGIVKAGPAIAVLGEAKAL", "Sequence Length": 35, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01508"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "Gram-negative bacteria:Escherichia coli D21 (MLC=0.32 µM), Escherichia coli D31 (MLC=0.32 µM), Serratia marcescens Db11 (MLC=4.5 µM), Serratia marcescens Db1108 (MLC=2.4 µM), Serratia marcescens Db1121 (MLC=2.2 µM), Serratia marcescens Strain 122 (MLC=2.9 µM), Pseudomonas aeruginosa OT97 (MLC=1.9 µM), Xenorhabdus nematophilus Xn21 (MLC=1.6 µM);Gram-positive bacteria:Bacillus megaterium Bmll (MLC=0.44 µM), Bacillus subtilis Bs11 (MLC=18 µM), B.thuringiensis Bt11 (MLC>133 µM), Streptococcus fecalis AD-4 (MLC=7.3 µM), Streptococcus fecalis DS16 (MLC>24 µM), Micrococcus luteus M111 (MLC=1.3 µM).", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C176H301N51O42S", "Mass": 3835.65, "PI": 10.73, "Net Charge": 7, "Hydrophobicity": -0.07, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1.3 hourYeast:3 minE.coli:2 min", "Function": "Cecropins have lytic and antibacterial activity against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Insect immunity isolation and structure of cecropin D and four minor antibacterial components from Cecropia pupae.", "Pubmed ID": "7140755", "Reference": "Eur J Biochem. 1982 Sep;127(1)207-217.", "Author": "Hultmark D, Engström A, Bennich H, Kapur R, Boman HG.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7140755"}, {"Title": "Molecular cloning, cDNA sequencing, and chemical synthesis of cecropin B from Hyalophora cecropia.", "Pubmed ID": "", "Author": "Xanthopoulos K.G.,Lee J.-Y.,Kockum K.,Faye I.,van Hofsten P."}, {"Title": "On the primary structures of lysozyme, cecropins and attacins from Hyalophora cecropia.", "Pubmed ID": "", "Author": "Lee J.-Y.,Kockum K.,von Hofsten P.,Faye I.,Boman H.G."}, {"Title": "The structure of the gene for cecropin B, an antibacterial immune protein from Hyalophora cecropia.", "Pubmed ID": "", "Author": "Faye I.,Kockum K.,Gan R.,Lee J.-Y.,Xanthopoulos G."}, {"Title": "Sequence and specificity of two antibacterial proteins involved in insect immunity.", "Pubmed ID": "", "Author": "Boman H.G.,Bennich H.,Engstroem A.,Hultmark D.,Steiner H."}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KAG", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDHOQSTUY", "Basic Residues": 9, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 18, "Polar Residues": 19, "Positive Residues": 9, "Negative Residues": 2, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05832", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KWKVFKKIEKMGRNIRNGIVKAGPAIAVLGEAKALG"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08001", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MNFSRIFFFVFALVLALSTVSAAPEPKWKVFKKIEKMGRNIRNGIVKAGPAIAVLGEAKALG"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_12482", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KWKVFKKIEKMGRNIRNGIVK"}]}}}
