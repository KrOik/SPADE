The preferred embodiments of the invention provide at least up to ten fold higher levels of insect controlling protein relative to the highest levels obtained using prior compositions. In particular, transgenic maize expressing higher levels of a protein designed to exhibit increased toxicity toward Coleopteran pests deliver superior levels of insect protection and are less likely to sponsor development of populations of target insects that are resistant to the insecticidally active protein."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_10842", "Sequence": "VWPYGNKKFETLSYLPPLSTGGRIRCMQAM", "Sequence Length": 30, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 28 from Patent US 20030115630", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Insecticidal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "GLP", "Absent Amino Acids": "DHOU", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 15, "Polar Residues": 15, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 3445.04, "PI": 9.63, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": -0.29, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_10840", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MAPTVMMASSATAVAPFLGLKSTASLPVARRSSRSLGNVSNGGRIRCMQVWPYGNKKFETLSYLPPLSTGGRIRCMQAM"}]}}}
