The present invention relates to novel antimicrobial peptides and derivatives thereof as well as the beta-defensin genes encoding the peptides. The invention further relates to methods of use of the peptides including a method of inhibiting microbial growth by administering an effective amount of the peptide alone or in combination with other antimicrobial agents or antibiotics."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03748", "Sequence": "CRSWGTCSIAAICFDSLSRRGQCGPVKDPCCPL", "Sequence Length": 33, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 78 from Patent US 20030176652", "Source": "Mus musculus", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CSG", "Absent Amino Acids": "EHMNOUY", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 12, "Polar Residues": 19, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 3531.12, "PI": 8.35, "Net Charge": 2, "Hydrophobicity": 0.11, "Similar Sequences": []}}}
