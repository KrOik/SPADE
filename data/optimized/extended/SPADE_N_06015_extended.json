The antimicrobial peptide analogue according to the present disclosure is designed based on hdMolluscidin which is a peptide derived from the gill of abalone and has been designed to be commercially viable by reducing the number of amino acids. Despite the reduced number of amino acids, the designed peptide analogue exhibits very superior antimicrobial activity as well as high membrane permeability and low hemolytic activity."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_06015", "Sequence": "AAWKLLKALAKA", "Sequence Length": 12, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 1 from Patent US 20180141984", "Source": "Haliotis discus", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "AKL", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEFGHIMNOPQRSTUVY", "Basic Residues": 3, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 9, "Polar Residues": 8, "Positive Residues": 3, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 1283.6, "PI": 10.3, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": 0.65, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_13244", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KAKAKKAAKAAWK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11779", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KAAKAAKKAAKAAWK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_21002", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KAKAKKAAKAAWK"}]}}}
