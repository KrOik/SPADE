Recombinant DNA molecules encoding such proteins. A vector comprising such DNA which is expressible in plants and which is linked to a plant operable promoter and terminator. Plants transformed with such recombinant DNA; the progeny of such plants which contain the DNA stably incorporated and hereditable in a Mendelian manner, and/or the seeds of such plants or such progeny."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_07921", "Sequence": "RCIPCGQDCISSRNCCSPCKCNFGPPVPRCTN", "Sequence Length": 32, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 12 from Patent US 6242574", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CPN", "Absent Amino Acids": "AEHLMOUWY", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 9, "Polar Residues": 21, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 3460.05, "PI": 8.54, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": -0.34, "Similar Sequences": []}}}
