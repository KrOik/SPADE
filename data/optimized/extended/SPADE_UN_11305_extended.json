To achieve this object, there are provided antibacterial peptides represented by the following formula: X-Ala-Ile-Arg-Lys-Arg-NH 2 â€ƒâ€ƒ( 1 ) wherein X is a peptide in which one or more than two amino acid residues are linked by peptide linkage, and Arg-NH 2 means that a carboxyl group of Arg is amidated."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11305", "Sequence": "LTCDLLSFEAKGFAA", "Sequence Length": 15, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 1 from Patent US 6476189", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "ALF", "Absent Amino Acids": "HIMNOPQRUVWY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 8, "Polar Residues": 7, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 1585.82, "PI": 4.37, "Net Charge": -1, "Hydrophobicity": 0.81, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05676", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LTCDLLSFEAKGFAANHSLCAAHCLAIGRKGGACQNGVCVCRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08071", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MSRFIVFAFIVAMCIAHSLAAPAPEALEASVIRQKRLTCDLLSFEAKGFAANHSLCAAHCLAIGRKGGACQNGVCVCRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_27232", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "AKGFAANHS"}]}}}
