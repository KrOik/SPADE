The invention also provides specific analogs or fragments of cathelicidin that function as agonists, as do endogenous cathelicidins, or as either dominant negatives or as inhibitors to endogenous cathelicidin or to other endogenous AMPs or that compete with pro-inflammatory agents or fragments of AMPs on cognate receptors without inducing disease."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_04280", "Sequence": "GLFGRLRDSLQRGGQKILEKAERIWCKIKDIFR", "Sequence Length": 33, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 79 from Patent US 20090048167", "Source": "Ovis sp.", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RGI", "Absent Amino Acids": "HMNOPTUVY", "Basic Residues": 9, "Acidic Residues": 4, "Hydrophobic Residues": 12, "Polar Residues": 14, "Positive Residues": 9, "Negative Residues": 4, "Mass": 3931.62, "PI": 10.43, "Net Charge": 5, "Hydrophobicity": -0.58, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02520", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GLFGRLRDSLQRGGQKILEKAERIWCKIKDIFRG"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_25178", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GLFGRLRDSLQRGGQKILEKAERIWCKIKDIFRG"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07638", "Similarity": 0.8888888888888888, "Sequence": "RDSLQRGGQKILEKAERIGDRIKDIFRG"}]}}}
