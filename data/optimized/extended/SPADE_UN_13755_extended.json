The antimicrobial peptide and the antimicrobial peptide composition have remarkably high antibacterial activity against gram-positive (+) and gram-negative (âˆ’) bacteria, compared to wild-type LPcin-I having an antimicrobial ability, which consists of a sequence of 29 amino acids. Also, the antimicrobial peptide can be useful in being easily synthesized and saving production costs since the antimicrobial peptide has a smaller number of amino acids, compared to the wild-type LPcin-I."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_13755", "Sequence": "NKVKEWWKWLKSL", "Sequence Length": 13, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 7 from Patent US 10150795", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KWL", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDFGHIMOPQRTUY", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 7, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 1745.07, "PI": 10.0, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": -1.1, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13750", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "NKVKEWWKWLKSLFS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13753", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "NKVKEWWKWLKSLFK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13758", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "NKVKEWWKWLK"}]}}}
