The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein- effector interaction. Involved in the abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene signaling pathways. Regulates acropetal transport of auxin (IAA) in roots and hypocotyls, and thus modulates root architecture (e.g. lateral root formation). The heterotrimeric G- protein controls defense responses to necrotrophic and vascular fungi probably by modulating cell wall-related genes expression; involved in resistance to fungal pathogens such as Alternaria brassicicola, Plectosphaerella cucumerina and Fusarium oxysporum.", "Tissue specificity": "Mostly expressed in seedlings (especially at the hypocotyl/root junction), young cauline leaves, open flowers, and floral stems, and, to a lower extent, in roots (restricted to the stele), rosette leaves (restricted to veins), siliques, and unopened floral buds.
