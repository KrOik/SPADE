Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03258", "Peptide Name": "4 kDa defensin (Antibacterial 4 kDa peptide; Arthropods, animals)", "Source": "Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus (Yellow scorpion)", "Family": "Belongs to the invertebrate defensin family (Type 2 subfamily)", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "GFGCPLNQGACHRHCRSIRRRGGYCAGFFKQTCTCYRN", "Sequence Length": 38, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P41965"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C181H279N65O48S6", "Mass": 4325.95, "PI": 9.69, "Net Charge": 9, "Hydrophobicity": -0.65, "Half Life": "Mammalian:30 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Antibacterial protein against Gram-positive bacteria; may act via membrane-permeabilization of these cells.", "PTM": "Contains three disulfide bonds 4-25; 11-33; 15-35 (By similarity).", "Literature": [{"Title": "Purification and characterization of a scorpion defensin, a 4kDa antibacterial peptide presenting structural similarities with insect defensins and scorpion toxins.", "Pubmed ID": "8333834", "Reference": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1993 Jul 15;194(1)17-22.", "Author": "Cociancich S, Goyffon M, Bontems F, Bulet P, Bouet F, Menez A, Hoffmann J.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8333834"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CGR", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEMOUVW", "Basic Residues": 9, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 10, "Polar Residues": 26, "Positive Residues": 9, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03257", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GFGCPLNQGACHRHCRSIRRRGGYCAGFFKQTCCYRN"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_29477", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "EKRRGGRLCYCRRRFCVCVGREKRRGLRRLGRKIAHGVKKYGPTVLRIIRIAGEKRGFGCPLNQGACHRHCRSIRRRGGYCAGFFKQTCTCYRNEKRVDKPDYRPRPWPRPNSR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03278", "Similarity": 0.9459459459459459, "Sequence": "GFGCPFNQGACHRHCRSIRRRGGYCAGLFKQTCTCYR"}]}}}
