The invention also provides specific analogs or fragments of cathelicidin that function as agonists, as do endogenous cathelicidins, or as either dominant negatives or as inhibitors to endogenous cathelicidin or to other endogenous AMPs or that compete with pro-inflammatory agents or fragments of AMPs on cognate receptors without inducing disease."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02462", "Peptide Name": "Cathelicidin-2 (Bactenecin-5, Bac5; PR-42; mammals, animals)", "Source": "Bos taurus (Bovine)", "Family": "Belongs to the cathelicidin family", "Gene": "CATHL2", "Sequence": "RFRPPIRRPPIRPPFYPPFRPPIRPPIFPPIRPPFRPPLGPFP", "Sequence Length": 43, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P19660", "http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/A5PJA3", "http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q24JY5"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "BAC5 sequence consists almost exclusively of X-P-P-Y repeats.", "Formula": "C255H382N70O45", "Mass": 5148.2, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 9, "Hydrophobicity": -0.72, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1 hourYeast:2 minE.coli:2 min", "Function": "Exerts, in vitro, a potent antimicrobial activity.
