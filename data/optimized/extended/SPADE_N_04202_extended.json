In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_04202", "Sequence": "MKFFVFALILALMLSMTGADSHAKRHHGYKRKFHEKHHSHRGYRSNYLYDN", "Sequence Length": 51, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 19 from Patent US 20080269122", "Source": "Homo sapiens", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "HKL", "Absent Amino Acids": "COPQUW", "Basic Residues": 16, "Acidic Residues": 3, "Hydrophobic Residues": 22, "Polar Residues": 32, "Positive Residues": 16, "Negative Residues": 3, "Mass": 6149.02, "PI": 10.09, "Net Charge": 13, "Hydrophobicity": -0.7, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03135", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "DSHAKRHHGYKRKFHEKHHSHRGYRSNYLYDN"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03137", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "DSHAKRHHGYKRKFHEKHHSHRGY"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03138", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "DSHAKRHHGYKRKFHEKHHSHRGYR"}]}}}
