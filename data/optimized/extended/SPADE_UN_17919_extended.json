Specifically, the invention relates to an isolated polypeptide, the amino acid sequence of which is that one or more amino acids in a mother sequence are removed, or one or more amino acids in the mother sequence are replaced by L-type amino acids or D-type amino acids with the same number, wherein the mother sequence is SEQ ID NO. 1, SEQ ID NO. 62 or SEQ ID NO. 63; and the polypeptide has activity of blocking alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChR. The polypeptide can specifically block alpha 9 alpha 10nAChR, and has good application prospect in the aspects of preparing analgesic drugs, drugs for treating mental diseases and cancers, neuroscience tool drugs and the like."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17919", "Sequence": "TCRSSGRYCRSPYDRRRRYCRRDTDACV", "Sequence Length": 28, "Peptide Name": "[I23D]GexIVA[1,4]", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RCD", "Absent Amino Acids": "EFHIKLMNOQUW", "Basic Residues": 9, "Acidic Residues": 3, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 23, "Positive Residues": 9, "Negative Residues": 3, "Mass": 3458.86, "PI": 9.92, "Net Charge": 6, "Hydrophobicity": -1.6, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17869", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GRYCRSPYDRRRRYCRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17881", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RYCRSPYDRRRRYCRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17870", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RSPYDRRRRY"}]}}}
