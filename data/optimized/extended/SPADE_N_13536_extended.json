And the classic paper in the ref is recommended by Dr. Gallo as the beginning (birth) of modern innate immunity.SAR: The structure and activity relationship of human lysozyme can be found in modern Biochemistry textbooks. It catalytically hydrolyzes bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan and has also been\nshown to exert catalysis-independent antimicrobial properties, thereby active against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. primary bactericidin in human plasma serum active against B. subtilis (Selsted and Martinez, 1978).Structure:You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structureherein the PDB.Synergy:AMPs: It showed synergistic effect with LL-37(Abou Aliwa et al., 2014).Pathogen infection strategy:  Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses a novel glycosylated and surface-localized lipoprotein, LprI, to abrogate the lytic activity of lysozyme(Sethi D eta l., 2016).AMPs in use: food preservation: lysozyme is used as Japan's most trusted preservative for fruits, vegetables, and food (https://www.bioseutica.com/products/lysozyme).
