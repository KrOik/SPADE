Specifically, the invention relates to an isolated polypeptide, the amino acid sequence of which is that one or more amino acids in a mother sequence are removed, or one or more amino acids in the mother sequence are replaced by L-type amino acids or D-type amino acids with the same number, wherein the mother sequence is SEQ ID NO. 1, SEQ ID NO. 62 or SEQ ID NO. 63; and the polypeptide has activity of blocking alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChR. The polypeptide can specifically block alpha 9 alpha 10nAChR, and has good application prospect in the aspects of preparing analgesic drugs, drugs for treating mental diseases and cancers, neuroscience tool drugs and the like."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17881", "Sequence": "RYCRSPYDRRRRYCRR", "Sequence Length": 16, "Peptide Name": "Δ7-22GeXIVA", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RYC", "Absent Amino Acids": "AEFGHIKLMNOQTUVW", "Basic Residues": 8, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 14, "Positive Residues": 8, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 2262.59, "PI": 11.24, "Net Charge": 7, "Hydrophobicity": -2.55, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07419", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "TCRSSGRYCRSPYDRRRRYCRRITDACV"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17833", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ACRSSGRYCRSPYDRRRRYCRRITDACV"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17834", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "TCASSGRYCRSPYDRRRRYCRRITDACV"}]}}}
