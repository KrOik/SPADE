Exhibits diverse biological activities, such as hemorrhage, hemolysis, edema, apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells or tumor cell lines, and antiparasitic activities, as well as regulation of platelet aggregation. Effects of snake L-amino oxidases on platelets are controversial, since they either induce aggregation or inhibit agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions By similarity. In addition, this protein inhibits dose-dependently the growth of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and yeast, probably by the generation of hydrogen peroxide.", "Tissue specificity": "Expressed by the venom gland.", "Miscellaneous": "Has parasiticidal activities against leishmania, as a result of enzyme-catalyzed hydrogen peroxide production.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Antibacterial and antiparasitic effects of Bothrops marajoensis venom and its fractions phospholipase A2 and L-amino acid oxidase.", "Pubmed ID": "19944711", "Reference": "Toxicon. 2010 Apr 1;55(4)795-804.", "Author": "Costa Torres AF, Dantas RT, Toyama MH, Diz Filho E, Zara FJ, Rodrigues de Queiroz MG, Pinto Nogueira NA, Rosa de Oliveira M, de Oliveira Toyama D, Monteiro HS, Martins AM.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19944711"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "EAD", "Absent Amino Acids": "MOQUWY", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 9, "Hydrophobic Residues": 16, "Polar Residues": 18, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 9, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02162", "Similarity": 0.8461538461538461, "Sequence": "ADDKNPLEECFREDDYEGFLEIAKNGLSTTSNPKRVVIVGAGMSGLAAY"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00236", "Similarity": 0.8157894736842105, "Sequence": "ADDKNPLEEFRETNYEVFLEIAKNGLKATSNPKRVVIVGAGMAGLSAAY"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02163", "Similarity": 0.8108108108108109, "Sequence": "ADDKNPLEECFRETDYEEFLEIARNGLKATSNPKRVV"}]}}}
