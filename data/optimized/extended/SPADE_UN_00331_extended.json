Examples of antimicrobial agents are antimicrobial peptides such as lactoferricins and antimicrobial enzymes such as lysozyme and glucose oxidase, and examples of enzymes are endoglucanase, xylanase, phytase, protease, galactanase, mannanase, dextranase, alpha-galactosidase, pectate lyase, alpha-amylase and glucoamylase. A fusion product comprising the antimicrobial agent and the enzyme and a cleavable linker is novel, and can be used in animal feed and animal feed additives. The invention also describes the use of a protection domain wherein at least 50% of the amino acid residues comprised in the peptide protection domain are D (Asp) and/or E (Glu). The protection or quenching domain serves to temporarily and reversibly inactivate the antimicrobial peptide during the expression."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_00331", "Peptide Name": "LFB (fragment of bovine lalctoferricin, residues 17 to 31)", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Family": "Not found", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "FKCRRWQWRMKKLGA", "Sequence Length": 15, "UniProt Entry": "No entry found", "Protein Existence": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "Gram-negative bacterium:Escherichia coli (MIC=24 µM);Gram-positive bacterium:Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=48 µM).", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C91H144N30O17S2", "Mass": 1994.44, "PI": 11.74, "Net Charge": 6, "Hydrophobicity": -1.21, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1.1 hourYeast:3 minE.coli:2 min", "Function": "Has antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacterium S. aureus and the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Antibacterial activity of 15-residue lactoferricin derivatives.", "Pubmed ID": "11095180", "Reference": "J Pept Res. 2000 Nov;56(5)265-274.", "Author": "StrÃ¸m MB, Rekdal O, Svendsen JS.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11095180"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KRW", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEHINOPSTUVY", "Basic Residues": 6, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 9, "Positive Residues": 6, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02451", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "FKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVRRAF"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06289", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "FKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06298", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "FKCRRWQWRMKK"}]}}}
