It reduces K. pneumoniae burden in kidney, liver, spleen, and lung when injected either intraperitoneally (i.p./i.p.) or intravenously (i.p./i.v.).Peptide formulation: nanofiber formulated peptide displayed antibiofilm activity in wound model:mouse (Su et al., 2020;Su et al., 2021;Su et al., 2023;John et al., 2023).Synergy:antibody:  Microneedle Patches Co-delivering Monoclonal Antibodies and W379 Effectively Eradicated Wound Biofilms (Su et al., 2024).Patent: published.Updated 6/2022; 8/2023; 12/2023; 2/2024; 11/2024", "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02907", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "SRDLICLCRNRRCNRGELFYGTCAGPFLRCCRRRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02908", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "SRDLICLCRKRRCNRGELFYGTCAGPFLRCCRRRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02991", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "FLRRSVSGFQECHSKGGYCYRYYCPRPHRRLGSCYPYAANCCRRRR"}]}}}
