In particular, the peptide molecules exhibit a high antimicrobial activity against numerous bacterial species, with reduced cytotoxicity and a low haemolysis rate. The molecules of the invention are advantageously usable as therapeutic agents and coadjutants against infections caused by strains that are resistant to common antibiotics."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11201", "Sequence": "QAKIRVRLSA", "Sequence Length": 10, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 2 from Patent US 20090053151", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "ARI", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEFGHMNOPTUWY", "Basic Residues": 3, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 5, "Polar Residues": 8, "Positive Residues": 3, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 1141.37, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": -0.11, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03059", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RWKVFKKIEKMGRNIRDGVIKAAPAIEVLGQAK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11335", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KLFRQAK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_22407", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "QAK"}]}}}
