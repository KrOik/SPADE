Development of new AMPs is arduous due to the practical limitations of classical protein-based discovery approaches. A high throughput bioinformatics approach is described which is able to confirm identification of known AMPs from the North American bullfrog ( Rana ( Lithobates ) catesbeiana ) genome, and a bioinformatics approach is used to develop new AMPs. The described AMPs exhibit antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis via microtitre broth dilution assays, indicating broader efficacy."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_13639", "Sequence": "MTQSTQKWFKTKYWRVRNRPAMSPDLNPIEHLWRDLKKVVGKR", "Sequence Length": 43, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 7 from Patent US 2022/0125873", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KRL", "Absent Amino Acids": "COU", "Basic Residues": 12, "Acidic Residues": 3, "Hydrophobic Residues": 18, "Polar Residues": 26, "Positive Residues": 12, "Negative Residues": 3, "Mass": 5327.2, "PI": 11.08, "Net Charge": 9, "Hydrophobicity": -1.15, "Similar Sequences": []}}}
