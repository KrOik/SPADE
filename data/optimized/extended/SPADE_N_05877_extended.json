The invention also provides specific analogs or fragments of cathelicidin that function as agonists, as do endogenous cathelicidins, or as either dominant negatives or as inhibitors to endogenous cathelicidin or to other endogenous AMPs or that compete with pro-inflammatory agents or fragments of AMPs on cognate receptors without inducing disease."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_05877", "Peptide Name": "BMAP-27 (Bovine, mammals, animals)", "Source": "Bos taurus (Bovine)", "Family": "Belongs to the cathelicidin family", "Gene": "CATHL6", "Sequence": "GRFKRFRKKFKKLFKKLSPVIPLLHL", "Sequence Length": 26, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P54228"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "[Ref.31226350] Gram-positive bacteria:Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=1-2 μM);Gram-negative bacteria:Escherichia coli (MIC=2-4 μM)", "Hemolytic Activity": "[Ref.31226350] 50% hemolysis at 75 μM for human red blood cells", "Cytotoxicity": "[Ref.31226350] The CC50 values which represent peptide concentration (μM) inducing 50% cytotoxicity to human cancer cell lines of BMAP-27 on MDA361 and A549 are 4.2 μM and 5.3 μM.
