The invention also provides specific analogs or fragments of cathelicidin that function as agonists, as do endogenous cathelicidins, or as either dominant negatives or as inhibitors to endogenous cathelicidin or to other endogenous AMPs or that compete with pro-inflammatory agents or fragments of AMPs on cognate receptors without inducing disease."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02522", "Peptide Name": "Cathelicidin-2 (Bactenecin-5, Bac5; OaBac5; mammals, animals)", "Source": "Ovis aries (Sheep)", "Family": "Belongs to the cathelicidin family", "Gene": "CATHL2", "Sequence": "RFRPPIRRPPIRPPFRPPFRPPVRPPIRPPFRPPFRPPIGPFP", "Sequence Length": 43, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P79362", "http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P79363"], "Protein Existence": "Transcript level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Lipipolysaccharides (LPS)-binding", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C251H384N76O44", "Mass": 5170.22, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 11, "Hydrophobicity": -1.0, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1 hourYeast:2 minE.coli:2 min", "Function": "Has potent antimicrobial activity (By similarity).", "Literature": [{"Title": "Localization and genomic organization of sheep antimicrobial peptide genes.", "Pubmed ID": "9461419", "Reference": "Gene. 1998 Jan 5;206(1)85-91.", "Author": "Huttner KM, Lambeth MR, Burkin HR, Burkin DJ, Broad TE.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9461419"}, {"Title": "Localization and genomic organization of sheep antimicrobial peptides genes.", "Pubmed ID": "", "Author": "Broad T.E.,Burkin H.R.,Lambeth M.R.,Huttner K.M."}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "PRF", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEHKLMNOQSTUWY", "Basic Residues": 11, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 31, "Polar Residues": 12, "Positive Residues": 11, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08751", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RFRPPIRRPPIRPPFRPPFRPPVR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_12876", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RFRPPIRRPPIRPPF"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_13261", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RFRPPIRRPPIRPPFRPPFRPPVRP"}]}}}
