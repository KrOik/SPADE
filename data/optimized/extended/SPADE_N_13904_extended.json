GRAVY: -0.55; Mol Wt: 10716.041; Mol formula:  C467H712N140O135S6; mol ex coeff: 23395.Chemical modification: N-terminus is a pyroglutamic acid, while the C-terminus is amidated. In addition, three disulfide bonds are formed: C1-C5, C2-C4, and C3-C6.Activity: active against Alcanivorax sp. 15.5817 (MIC 2.5 uM), Alteromonas sp. 15.5805 (MIC 1.25 uM), Aquimarina sp.
