Exemplary peptides of the invention include KWKSFIKKLTSAAKKVVTTAKPLALIS (SEQ ID NO:3) and KGWGSFFKKAAHVGKHVGKAALTHYL (SEQ ID NO:15). Also provided are methods for inhibiting the growth of bacteria utilizing the peptides of the invention. Such methods are useful for the treatment of respiratory infections, such as in cystic fibrosis patients. Such methods are further useful for accelerating wound healing."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02677", "Peptide Name": "Ceratotoxin-B (Insects, animals)", "Source": "Ceratitis capitata (Mediterranean Fruit fly)", "Family": "Not found", "Gene": "CTXB", "Sequence": "SIGSAFKKALPVAKKIGKAALPIAKAALP", "Sequence Length": 29, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P36191"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "[Swiss_Prot Entry P36191]Female-specific peptides with potent activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria", "Hemolytic Activity": "[Swiss_Prot Entry P36191]has hemolytic activity", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C135H235N35O32", "Mass": 2860.53, "PI": 10.7, "Net Charge": 6, "Hydrophobicity": 0.54, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1.9 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Female-specific peptides with potent activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
