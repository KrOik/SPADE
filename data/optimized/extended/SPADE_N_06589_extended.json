The peptides of the present invention selected two peptides (v6Pep-1 and v6Pep-2) that bind well to cells with high expression of human CD44v6 protein using phage peptide display technology and it was confirmed that it interferes with the binding between c-Met and CD44v6 to inhibit cancer cell migration. The peptide of the present invention is relatively stable in serum and shows a high potential as an anticancer treatment agent that suppresses metastasis due to the progression and migration of cancer in the future."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_06589", "Sequence": "CNEWQLKSC", "Sequence Length": 9, "Peptide Name": "v6Pep-2", "Source": "Screen of phage display p", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CEK", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADFGHIMOPRTUVY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 2, "Polar Residues": 6, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 1110.26, "PI": 5.99, "Net Charge": 0, "Hydrophobicity": -0.81, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06355", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MICYSHKTPQPSATITCEEKTCYKKSVRKLPAIVAGRGCGCPSKEMLVAIHCCRSDKCNE"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00878", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KSCCRNTVARNCYNVCRIPGTPRPVCAATCDCKLITGTKCPPGYEK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00879", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KSCCRNTTARNCYNVCRIPG"}]}}}
