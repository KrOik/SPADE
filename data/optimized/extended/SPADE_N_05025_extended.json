The toxin peptides are characterized by their neurotoxic effect on insect pest and potential for little, if any, toxicity in mammals. Coding polynucleotide sequences for the toxin peptides are described, as are methods and vectors for production and targeted delivery of recombinant toxin peptides. Methods for the use of the toxin peptides as insecticides are also provided."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_05025", "Sequence": "GCLGEGEKCADWSGPSCCDGFYCSCRSMPYCRCRNNS", "Sequence Length": 37, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 7 from Patent WO 2001070773", "Source": "Paracoelotes luctuosus", "Biological Activity": ["Insecticidal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CGS", "Absent Amino Acids": "HIOQTUV", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 4, "Hydrophobic Residues": 9, "Polar Residues": 22, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 4, "Mass": 4046.53, "PI": 6.16, "Net Charge": 0, "Hydrophobicity": -0.56, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_10930", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MYKLTVFLMFIAFVIIAEAGCLGEGEKCADWSGPSCCDGFYCSCRSMPYCRCRNNS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05446", "Similarity": 0.7837837837837838, "Sequence": "ACVGDGQRCASWSGPYCCDGYYCSCRSMPYCRCRNNS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_10931", "Similarity": 0.7837837837837838, "Sequence": "MYKLTVFLMFIAFVIIAEAACVGDGQRCASWSGPYCCDGYYCSCRSMPYCRCRNNS"}]}}}
