More specifically, it refers to a peptide called gomesin, with 18 amino acid residues, configured as a clamp-like structure consisting of two anti-parallel beta-folded sheets joined by a beta turn, containing four invariable residues of cystein forming two disulphide bridges, optionally configurable as a cyclic chain with closed edges."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03799", "Sequence": "XCHKMCLKQHCYAWCRGR", "Sequence Length": 18, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 48 from Patent US 20030186854", "Source": "Arachinid", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antiparasitic", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CHK", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEFINOPSTUV", "Basic Residues": 6, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 5, "Polar Residues": 13, "Positive Residues": 6, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03847", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "CHKMCLKQHCYAWCRG"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17237", "Similarity": 0.8, "Sequence": "ACRGRGRGCGRGRGRCG"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17241", "Similarity": 0.8, "Sequence": "ACRGRRRGCGRRRGRCG"}]}}}
