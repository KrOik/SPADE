The invention connects E selectin peptide ligand with chemotherapeutic drugs such as taxanes, camptothecins, podophyllotoxin and the like through disulfide bonds, then connects the conjugate to carboxyl of hyaluronic acid, and the formed amphiphilic polymer can be self-assembled in aqueous solution to form a primary nano targeting micelle and can be further loaded with other functional molecules, such as chemotherapeutic drugs and/or photosensitizer indocyanine green, to form a multifunctional nano micelle: the micelle has the active targeting tumor effect mediated by hyaluronic acid and tumor targeting peptide and the passive targeting effect mediated by nano micelle EPR effect, has the characteristic of the synergistic effect of photothermal photodynamic and chemotherapy, and can competitively inhibit the adhesion of vascular endothelial cells and tumor cells mediated"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17753", "Sequence": "RAQLLEIC", "Sequence Length": 8, "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LAC", "Absent Amino Acids": "DFGHKMNOPSTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 4, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 945.14, "PI": 5.99, "Net Charge": 0, "Hydrophobicity": 0.61, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17752", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "CRAQLLEI"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17756", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "CRAQLLEI"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17757", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RAQLLEIC"}]}}}
