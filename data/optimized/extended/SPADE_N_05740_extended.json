Compositions and methods of using dermaseptin-type and piscidin-type antimicrobial peptides that demonstrate activity and improved therapeutic indices against microbial pathogens. The peptide compositions demonstrate the ability to not only maintain or improve antimicrobial activity against bacterial pathogens including Gram-negative microorganisms Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but also significantly decrease hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. Specificity determinants within the AMPS change selectivity from broad spectrum antimicrobial activity to AMPS with gram-negative selectivity."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_05740", "Peptide Name": "Dermaseptin-S4 (DRS-S4, DS4; frog, amphibians, animals)", "Source": "Phyllomedusa sauvagei (Sauvage's leaf frog)", "Family": "Belongs to the frog skin active peptide (FSAP) family.

Probably acts by disturbing membrane functions with its amphipathic structure. Binds to healthy erythrocytes (this binding is receptor independent), and has strong hemolytic activity. Does not bind to P.falciparum infected erythrocytes, but accumulates within the parasite. Kills the parasite, and only at high concentrations has a hemolytic activity on the host cell.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Isolation and structure of novel defensive peptides from frog skin.", "Pubmed ID": "8306981", "Reference": "Eur.
