Compositions include amino acid sequences, and variants and fragments thereof, for novel variants of antipathogenic polypeptides generated through DNA shuffling that exhibit improved antipathogenic activity. Polynucleotides that encode the antipathogenic polypeptides are also provided. A method for inducing pathogen resistance in a plant using the polynucleotides disclosed herein is further provided. Compositions comprising an antipathogenic polypeptide or a microorganism comprising an antipathogenic polynucleotide of the invention in combination with a carrier and methods of using these compositions to protect a plant from a pathogen are further provided. Plants, plant cells, seeds, and microorganisms comprising an antipathogenic polynucleotide or polypeptide of the invention are also disclosed."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_08877", "Sequence": "HDEF", "Sequence Length": 4, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 32 from Patent US 20120102595", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "DEF", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACGIKLMNOPQRSTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 1, "Polar Residues": 1, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 546.53, "PI": 4.35, "Net Charge": -1, "Hydrophobicity": -1.85, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_10126", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "DEFDASISQVNEKINQSLAFIRKSDELL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_10138", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "DEFDASISQVNEKINQSLAFIRKSDELLHNVNAGK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00533", "Similarity": 0.75, "Sequence": "NMSVDQKRCWATLKENNCVHDECRSMCLKKNPKGHGRCIKSSKGRIICLCGYDCP"}]}}}
