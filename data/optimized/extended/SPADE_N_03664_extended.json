Prototype proteins can be isolated from Macadaniia integrifolia as well as other plant species. DNA encoding the protein is also described as well as DNA constructs which can be used to express the antimicrobial protein or to introduce the antimicrobial protein into a plant. Compositions comprising the antimicrobial proteins or the antimicrobial protein per se can be administered to plants or mammilian animals to combat microbial infestation."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03664", "Sequence": "VKEDHQFETRGEILECYRLCQQQ", "Sequence Length": 23, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 26 from Patent US 20020168392", "Source": "Stenocarpus sinuatus", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "EQC", "Absent Amino Acids": "AMNOPSUW", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 5, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 13, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 5, "Mass": 2853.15, "PI": 4.96, "Net Charge": -1, "Hydrophobicity": -1.13, "Similar Sequences": []}}}
