The mode of action is presumably an arrest in the G0/G1 phase. Antiproliferative, proapoptotic and DNA-binding activities are increased by acetylation at Ala-1 and Lys-3. Has a weak hemolytic activity against mouse erythrocytes. Has antibacterial activity. Antibacterial activity is decreased by acetylation.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Identification and characterization of a bactericidal and proapoptotic peptide from Cycas revoluta seeds with DNA binding properties.", "Pubmed ID": "21882228", "Reference": "J Cell Biochem. 2012 Jan;113(1)184-193.", "Author": "Mandal SM, Migliolo L, Das S, Mandal M, Franco OL, Hazra TK.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21882228"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "DAF", "Absent Amino Acids": "CEHIMNOPQRSTUY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 5, "Polar Residues": 3, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 2, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08523", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "FLGALFKVAWK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_13244", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KAKAKKAAKAAWK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_13245", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KAKAKKAKAWK"}]}}}
