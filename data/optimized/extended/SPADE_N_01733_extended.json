The composition can also include an effective amount of at least one of a growth factor and a neuropeptide. The present invention also relates a method of treating an injury to a nervous system of an animal that includes the steps of identifying the injury to the nervous system and applying to the injury an effective amount of at least one of antimicrobial peptide and a substance having an antimicrobial peptide effect. The method can also include applying an effective amount of one or more trophic factors selected from the group consisting of a growth factor, a neurotrophin, and a neuropeptide to the injury."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_01733", "Peptide Name": "Brevinin-1Sb (Frogs, amphibians, animals)", "Source": "Rana sphenocephala (Southern leopard frog)", "Family": "Belongs to the frog skin active peptide family (Brevinin subfamily)", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "FLPAIVGAAGKFLPKIFCAISKKC", "Sequence Length": 24, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P82905"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "Gram-negative bacterium:Escherichia coli (MIC=17 ÂµM).", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C121H196N28O26S2", "Mass": 2523.15, "PI": 9.7, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": 1.06, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1.1 hourYeast:3 minE.coli:2 min", "Comments": "No comments found on DRAMP database", "Literature": [{"Title": "Peptides with antimicrobial activity of the brevinin-1 family isolated from skin secretions of the southern leopard frog, Rana sphenocephala.", "Pubmed ID": "10604597", "Reference": "J Pept Res. 1999 Dec;54(6)522-527.", "Author": "Conlon JM, Halverson T, Dulka J, Platz JE, Knoop FC.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10604597"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "AKF", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEHMNOQRTUWY", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 15, "Polar Residues": 12, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_01732", "Similarity": 0.9583333333333334, "Sequence": "FLPAIVGAAGQFLPKIFCAISKKC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_15694", "Similarity": 0.9583333333333334, "Sequence": "FLPAIVGAAAKFLPKIFCAISKKC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00134", "Similarity": 0.9583333333333334, "Sequence": "FLPAIVGAAAKFLPKIFCAISKKC"}]}}}
