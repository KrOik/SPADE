The peptides obtained have significantly improved antimicrobial activity and lack the ability to lyse mammalian cells, which may be toxic to a host. The peptides may be designed according to certain guidelines, and may further be modified by the addition of altered residues and alterations in normal peptide secondary and tertiary structure, including modifications in quaternary (multimeric) structure."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_01467", "Sequence": "RDVSRRFMRRGRDVSRRFMRR", "Sequence Length": 21, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 24 from Patent US 7745390", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RDF", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACEHIKLNOPQTUWY", "Basic Residues": 10, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 14, "Positive Residues": 10, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 2796.25, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 8, "Hydrophobicity": -1.72, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_01465", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RDVSRRFMRRGSRDVSRRFMRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_01466", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RDVSRRFMRRGSRDVSRRFMRRGSRDVSRRFMRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_01468", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RDVSRRFMRRRDVSRRFMRR"}]}}}
