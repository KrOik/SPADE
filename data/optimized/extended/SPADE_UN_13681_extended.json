Development of new AMPs is arduous due to the practical limitations of classical protein-based discovery approaches. A high throughput bioinformatics approach is described which is able to confirm identification of known AMPs from the North American bullfrog ( Rana ( Lithobates ) catesbeiana ) genome, and a bioinformatics approach is used to develop new AMPs. The described AMPs exhibit antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis via microtitre broth dilution assays, indicating broader efficacy."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_13681", "Sequence": "SNRKFFKVRIFRLCG", "Sequence Length": 15, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 53 from Patent US 2022/0125873", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "FRK", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADEHMOPQTUWY", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 9, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 1871.26, "PI": 11.72, "Net Charge": 5, "Hydrophobicity": -0.17, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13680", "Similarity": 0.8666666666666667, "Sequence": "SNRDFFKVNIFRLCG"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13693", "Similarity": 0.8, "Sequence": "SNRKFFMVNIFGLCGPFGIMKRKRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_22014", "Similarity": 0.8, "Sequence": "KKFFK"}]}}}
