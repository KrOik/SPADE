Inhibits bacterial protein biosynthesis by acting on the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) (By similarity).", "PTM": "Maturation of thiazole and oxazole containing antibiotics involves the enzymic condensation of a Cys, Ser or Thr with the alpha-carbonyl of the preceding amino acid to form a thioether or ether bond, then dehydration to form a double bond with the alpha-amino nitrogen. Thiazoline or oxazoline ring are dehydrogenated to form thiazole or oxazole rings. Maturation of pyridinyl containing antibiotics involves the cross-linking of a Ser and a Cys-Ser pair usually separated by 7 or 8 residues along the peptide chain. The Ser residues are dehydrated to didehydroalanines, then bonded between their beta carbons. The alpha carbonyl of the Cys condenses with alpha carbon of the first Ser to form a pyridinyl ring. The ring may be multiply dehydrogenated to form a pyridine ring with loss of the amino nitrogen of the first Ser.", "Medical use": "Available under the names Animax (Dechra) and Panolog (Fort Dodge), that combine thiostrepton with nystatin (antifungal), neomycin (antibiotic) and triamcinolone (corticosteroid).
