Specifically, a hybridoma C-26 strain (FERM P-21875) and a hybridoma C-69 strain (FERM P-21876) producing anti-mortalin monoclonal antibodies having the function of being internalized by cancer cells and specificity to mortalin antigens, and having the good function of suppressing the cancer cell proliferation in vivo were obtained from hybridoma clones obtained using as an immunogen cocktail of the 2 types of peptide containing â€œLFGRAPâ€ and â€œKAMQDAEVSKSDIGEVIâ€ epitopes for an anti-mortalin antibody having the function of being internalized by cancer cells. Thus, anticancer agents containing the monoclonal antibodies as active ingredients could also be provided. Moreover, the epitope sequences recognized by these monoclonal antibodies were confirmed to be â€œEVILVGâ€ and â€"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11066", "Sequence": "KAMQDAEVSKSDIGEVIC", "Sequence Length": 18, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 4 from Patent US 20120302729", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "ADE", "Absent Amino Acids": "FHLNOPRTUWY", "Basic Residues": 2, "Acidic Residues": 4, "Hydrophobic Residues": 7, "Polar Residues": 10, "Positive Residues": 2, "Negative Residues": 4, "Mass": 1923.17, "PI": 4.32, "Net Charge": -2, "Hydrophobicity": -0.11, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11065", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KAMQDAEVSKSDIGEVI"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11069", "Similarity": 0.9444444444444444, "Sequence": "KAMQDAEVSKSDIGEVILVGGMTRMPKVQQTVQDLFGRAPSKAVNPDEAV"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05377", "Similarity": 0.5714285714285714, "Sequence": "MQDALKEDIGLDEAVGIMTGQVVYKYEEAQENE"}]}}}
