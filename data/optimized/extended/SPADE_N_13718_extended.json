This peptide, and (3) residues V1 and C2, as well as residues G3 and C4 are fused to thiazoles. Finally, the hydroxyl group of T6 and the C-terminal carboxylic group of F11 forms an ester bond, leading to a sidechain-backbone cyclized peptide.Activity: This peptide, after its discovery in 2020 (see ref), has been totally synthesized by two labs and reproted in 2021. One lab reported moderate activity against B. subtilis BCRC 10614 (MIC 64 ug/ml). At the maximal concentration (64 ug/ml) tested, this peptide didn't inhibit E-coli DH5alpha, E-faecalis BCRC 10789, S-aureus BCRC 11863, K-pneumoniae BCRC 11546, A-baumannii BCRC 10591, P-aeruginosa BCRC 11864, E-cloacae BCRC 10401, and C-albicans BCRC 21538 (PMID: 34595153).
