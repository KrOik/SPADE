It has antimicrobial activity towards bacteria and fungi and exerts its antimicrobial activity probably via chelation of Zn2+ which is essential for microbial growth. Can induce cell death via autophagy and apoptosis and this occurs through the cross-talk of mitochondria and lysosomes via reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the process involves BNIP3. Can regulate neutrophil number and apoptosis by an anti-apoptotic effect.", "Miscellaneous": "Binds two calcium ions per molecule with an affinity similar to that of the S100 proteins (By similarity).", "Literature": [{"Title": "Dynamic mobility of immunological cells expressing S100A8 and S100A9 in vivo a variety of functional roles of the two proteins as regulators in acute inflammatory reaction.", "Pubmed ID": "21487906", "Reference": "Inflammation. 2012 Apr;35(2)409-419.", "Author": "Koike A, Arai S, Yamada S, Nagae A, Saita N, Itoh H, Uemoto S, Totani M, Ikemoto M.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21487906"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "EVN", "Absent Amino Acids": "OUW", "Basic Residues": 15, "Acidic Residues": 14, "Hydrophobic Residues": 36, "Polar Residues": 53, "Positive Residues": 15, "Negative Residues": 14, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02889", "Similarity": 0.7954545454545454, "Sequence": "PSELEKALSNLIDVYHNYSNIQGNHHALYKNDFKKMVTTECPQFVQNINIENLFRELDINSDNAINFEEFLAMVIKVGVASHKDSHKE"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03180", "Similarity": 0.625, "Sequence": "MLTELEKALNSIIDVYHKYSLIKGNFHAVYRDDLKKLLETECPQYIRKKGADVWFKELDINTDGAVNFQEFLILVIKMGVAAHKKSHEESHKE"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02443", "Similarity": 0.5681818181818182, "Sequence": "MLTDLECAINSLIDVYHKYSLKKGNYHAVYRDDLKQLLETECPKFMKKKDADTWFKELDINQDGGINFEEFLVLVIKVGLEAHEEIHKE"}]}}}
