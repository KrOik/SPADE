Contains an odd number (13) of Cys. Assuming 6 S-S bridges intramolecularly, the left one is likely to form a dimer with another copy to enhance its host defense role.  It is speculated that Splys-i is stored in the cell in an inactive dimer form while exerting its activity in monomer form. Its expression is up-regulated upon bacterial challenge.Activity: Active against Gram- V. alginolyticus (MIC <9.2 uM), V. parahaemolyticus  (MIC <9.2 uM), V. harveyi  (MIC <4.6 uM), E. coli  JM109 (less than 18 uM), Gram+ S. aureus  (MIC <2.3 uM), B. subtilis  (MIC <4.6 uM), B. megaterium (MIC< 4.6 uM), C. albicans (MIC <18.4 uM) and P-pastoris GS-115 (MIC>18.4 uM). This atypical lysozyme Splys-i is an anionic protein without muramidase activity of normal lysozyme. It is proposed that its muramidase-deficient antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the specific polysaccharide-binding activity and to the incurred agglutination activity at uM (bacteria-agglutinating).Structure: predicted to have a helical fold.Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: expressed in inclusion bodies after IPTG induction.updated 7/2021; 11/2023", "Similar Sequences": []}}}
