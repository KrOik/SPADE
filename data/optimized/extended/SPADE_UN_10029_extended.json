The peptides of the invention consist of a 16 to 39 amino acid region of a human respiratory syncytial virus protein. These regions were identified through computer algorithms capable of recognizing the ALLMOTI5, 107x178x4, or PLZIP amino acid motifs. These motifs are associated with the antifusogenic and antiviral activities of the claimed peptides."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_10029", "Sequence": "IARLEEKVKTLKAQNSELASTANMLREQ", "Sequence Length": 28, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 86 from Patent US 6228983", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antiviral"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "AEL", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDFGHOPUWY", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 4, "Hydrophobic Residues": 11, "Polar Residues": 18, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 4, "Mass": 3172.61, "PI": 8.5, "Net Charge": 1, "Hydrophobicity": -0.67, "Similar Sequences": []}}}
