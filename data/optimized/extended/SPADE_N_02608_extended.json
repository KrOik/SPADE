Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02608", "Peptide Name": "Bombolitin I (insects, arthropods, invertebrates, animals)", "Source": "Megabombus pennsylvanicus (Bumblebee)", "Family": "Not found", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "IKITTMLAKLGKVLAHV", "Sequence Length": 17, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P10521"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti Mammalian Cells"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "[Ref.2578459] Hemolysis:ED50=4.0±0.05 µg/ml.
