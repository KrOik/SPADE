Actagardine, Ala(0)-actagardine, actagardine B, michiganin A, NAI-802 and Ala(0)-NAI-802 share three conserved thioether bridges within a core 19-aa peptide consisting of 14 invariant residues.", "Formula": "C90H149N25O29S4", "Mass": 2173.56, "PI": 6.01, "Net Charge": 0, "Hydrophobicity": 1.02, "Half Life": "Mammalian:4.4 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Comments": "As expected from the overall higher positive charge, NAI-802 was slightly more active than actagardine against staphylococci and streptococci. Further improvement of its antibacterial activity was achieved by adding one additional positive charge through conversion of the C-terminal carboxylate into the corresponding basic amide.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Isolation and characterization of NAI-802, a new lantibiotic produced by two different Actinoplanes strains.", "Pubmed ID": "23168402", "Reference": "J Antibiot (Tokyo). 2013 Feb;66(2)73-8.", "Author": "Simone M, Monciardini P, Gaspari E, Donadio S, Maffioli SI.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23168402"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CTA", "Absent Amino Acids": "DFHKMNOPQUY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 8, "Polar Residues": 14, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 1, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06163", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "SSGWVCTLTIECGTVICAC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07649", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ICACRRRFCPNSERFSGYCRVNGARYVRCCSRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00051", "Similarity": 0.9473684210526315, "Sequence": "ASGWVCTLTIECGTVICAC"}]}}}
