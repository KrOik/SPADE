Predicted to be helical.Activity: Active against Gram- V. parahaemolyticus 1.1616/ATCC 33847 (MIC 10 uM).AMP Significance: The V. parahaemolyticus pathogen causes scallop disease and may be treated by this peptide.MOA:bacteria:V. parahaemolyticus: membrane permeation.Antivirulence:bacteria:V. parahaemolyticus:  Sub-lethal levels of NKL-24 obviously reduced bacterial swimming ability and downregulated the transcription of the selected genes associated with bacterial virulence.In vitro toxicity: It is not toxic to hemocytes of scallops till 100 uM.Animal model:scallops: Survival experiment: compared to the control (20% survived), 60% scallops survived either pretreatment before infection or treatment after infection via injection of 20 ug in 4h or 5 ug in  2 h.
