Exhibits diverse biological activities, such as hemorrhage, hemolysis, edema, apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells or tumor cell lines, antibacterial and antiparasitic activities By similarity. In addition, this protein has an ability to induce apoptosis in cultured HeLa and K562 cells, and inhibits ADP-induced platelet aggregation dose-dependently. Effects of snake L-amino oxidases on platelets are controversial, since they either induce aggregation or inhibit agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions.", "Tissue specificity": "Expressed by the venom gland.", "Biophysicochemical properties": "Kinetic parameters (KM=0.361 mM for L-Leu; KM=0.286 mM for L-Met; KM=0.058 mM for L-Phe).", "Literature": [{"Title": "Isolation and characterization of an apoptotic and platelet aggregation inhibiting L-amino acid oxidase from Vipera berus berus (common viper) venom.", "Pubmed ID": "16574513", "Reference": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 2006 Apr;1764(4)707-714.", "Author": "Samel M, Vija H, RÃ¶nnholm G, Siigur J, Kalkkinen N, Siigur E.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16574513"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "EKD", "Absent Amino Acids": "OU", "Basic Residues": 14, "Acidic Residues": 16, "Hydrophobic Residues": 37, "Polar Residues": 44, "Positive Residues": 14, "Negative Residues": 16, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03223", "Similarity": 0.9, "Sequence": "ADDRNPLEECFRETDYEEFLEIARNGLKKT"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00179", "Similarity": 0.8666666666666667, "Sequence": "ADDRNPLEECFRETDYEEFLEIAKNGLSTT"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02163", "Similarity": 0.8648648648648649, "Sequence": "ADDKNPLEECFRETDYEEFLEIARNGLKATSNPKRVV"}]}}}
