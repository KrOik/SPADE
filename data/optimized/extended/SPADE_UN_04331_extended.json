Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions comprising these peptides and methods of using such peptides to control microbial growth or to treat or reduce incidence of infections caused by such microorganisms. Also disclosed are peptides at least one or all amino acids in the D configuration. Compositions disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of bacterial, mycobacterial and/or fungal infections or for reducing microbial cell numbers or growth on surfaces or in materials."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_04331", "Sequence": "XGAKGAGVGL", "Sequence Length": 10, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 63 from Patent US 20100099614", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "GAK", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEFHIMNOPQRSTUWY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 4, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_04291", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "SSLLEKGLDGAK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06450", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "FKARRWQWRMKKLGAFKARRWQWRMKKLGAK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00402", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "TLRGDERILSILRHQNLLKELQDLALQGAK"}]}}}
