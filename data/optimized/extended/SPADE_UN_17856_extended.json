Specifically, the invention relates to an isolated polypeptide, the amino acid sequence of which is that one or more amino acids in a mother sequence are removed, or one or more amino acids in the mother sequence are replaced by L-type amino acids or D-type amino acids with the same number, wherein the mother sequence is SEQ ID NO. 1, SEQ ID NO. 62 or SEQ ID NO. 63; and the polypeptide has activity of blocking alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChR. The polypeptide can specifically block alpha 9 alpha 10nAChR, and has good application prospect in the aspects of preparing analgesic drugs, drugs for treating mental diseases and cancers, neuroscience tool drugs and the like."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17856", "Sequence": "TCASSGAYCASPYDAAAAYCAAITDACV", "Sequence Length": 28, "Peptide Name": "[R3A/R7A/R10A/R15A/R16A/R17A/R18A/R21A/", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "ACS", "Absent Amino Acids": "EFHKLMNOQRUW", "Basic Residues": 0, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 16, "Polar Residues": 23, "Positive Residues": 0, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 2690.96, "PI": 4.05, "Net Charge": -2, "Hydrophobicity": 0.71, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17857", "Similarity": 0.8214285714285714, "Sequence": "TCRSSGRYCRSPYDAAAAYCRRITDACV"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17858", "Similarity": 0.7857142857142857, "Sequence": "TCASSGAYCASPYDRRRRYCRRITDACV"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17859", "Similarity": 0.75, "Sequence": "TCASSGAYCRSPYDRRRRYCRRITDACV"}]}}}
