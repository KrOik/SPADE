Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_01998", "Peptide Name": "Xenopsin precursor fragment (XPF; Frogs, amphibians, animals)", "Source": "Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog)", "Family": "Belongs to the magainin family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "GWASKIGQTLGKIAKVGLKELIQPK", "Sequence Length": 25, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P07198"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-", "Antifungal"], "Target Organism": "Gram-negative bacteria:Escherichia coli (MIC=16-31 µg/ml), K.
