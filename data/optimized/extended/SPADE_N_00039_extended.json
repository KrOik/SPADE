The first lanthionine S3-C7 and the second methyllanthionine T8-C12 are identical in the two proposed structures. A third intra-bond is either S11-C17 or C17-T19 (or C17-T20 or C17-T21). Compared to Streptin 1, Streptin 2 contains 3 additional residues TPY at the N-terminus. Small quantities of peptides at various degrees of dehydration were also detected.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Purification and characterization of streptin, a type A1 lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus pyogenes.", "Pubmed ID": "12732544", "Reference": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 2003 May;69(5)2737-2747.", "Author": "Wescombe PA, Tagg JR.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12732544"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "TCV", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADEHIMNOQU", "Basic Residues": 3, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 9, "Polar Residues": 16, "Positive Residues": 3, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00001", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MNNTIKDFDLDLKTNKKDTATPYVGSRYLCTPGSCWKLVCFTTTVK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00038", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GSRYLCTPGSCWKLVCFTTTVK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02149", "Similarity": 0.5714285714285714, "Sequence": "VLSKSLCTPGCITGPLQTCYLCFPTFAKC"}]}}}
