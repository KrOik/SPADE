In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02473", "Peptide Name": "Bovine Beta-defensin 6 (bBD-6; BNBD-6; BNDB-6; mammals, animals)", "Source": "Bos taurus (Bovine)", "Family": "Belongs to the beta-defensin family", "Gene": "DEFB6", "Sequence": "QGVRNHVTCRIYGGFCVPIRCPGRTRQIGTCFGRPVKCCRRW", "Sequence Length": 42, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P46164"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "Gram-positive bacterium:Staphylococcus aureus 502A (MIC=10-300 µg/ml);Gram-negative bacterium:Escherichia coli ML35 (MIC=10-300 µg/ml).", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C207H335N73O50S6", "Mass": 4838.72, "PI": 10.74, "Net Charge": 10, "Hydrophobicity": -0.34, "Half Life": "Mammalian:0.8 hourYeast:10 minE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Has bactericidal activity.
