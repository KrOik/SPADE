The CTP of this invention exhibits a transduction potential identical or higher than the conventional protein transduction, PTD, and a strong tendency to remain in the cytoplasm, so that it is very useful in inducing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and a drug delivery system (DDS) targeting cytoplasm."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17724", "Sequence": "CWKKKKKKKK", "Sequence Length": 10, "Peptide Name": "AlkCWK8 (SEQ ID NO:5)", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KCW", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADEFGHILMNOPQRSTUVY", "Basic Residues": 8, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 1, "Polar Residues": 9, "Positive Residues": 8, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 1332.75, "PI": 10.49, "Net Charge": 8, "Hydrophobicity": -2.96, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17723", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "CWKKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17725", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "CWKKKKKKKKKKKKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17726", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "CWKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK"}]}}}
