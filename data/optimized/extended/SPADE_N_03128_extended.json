The invention also provides specific analogs or fragments of cathelicidin that function as agonists, as do endogenous cathelicidins, or as either dominant negatives or as inhibitors to endogenous cathelicidin or to other endogenous AMPs or that compete with pro-inflammatory agents or fragments of AMPs on cognate receptors without inducing disease."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03128", "Peptide Name": "LL-23 (Derived from LL-37)", "Source": "Homo sapiens (Human sweat)", "Family": "Not found", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQR", "Sequence Length": 23, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P49913", "http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q71SN9"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-", "Antifungal"], "Target Organism": "Gram-negative bacterium:Escherichia coli DC2 (MIC=9 µM);Gram-positive bacteria:Staphylococcus aureus mprF (presence of carbonate) (MIC=3 µM), S. aureu mprF (absence of carbonate) (MIC=24 µM).", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Linear", "N-terminal Modification": "Free", "C-terminal Modification": "Free", "Stereochemistry": "L", "Structure Description": "The Ser9 site splits the hydrophobic surface of the amphipathic helix into two domains, which explains its poor antimicrobial activity (active against only susceptible bacterial strains).", "Formula": "C130H216N38O32", "Mass": 2823.34, "PI": 10.55, "Net Charge": 5, "Hydrophobicity": -0.84, "Half Life": "Mammalian:5.5 hourYeast:3 minE.coli:2 min", "Comments": "Its structure, dynamics, and antimicrobial and immune modulating activities have been characterized (Biochemistry 2012).", "Literature": [{"Title": "Kallikrein-mediated proteolysis regulates the antimicrobial effects of cathelicidins in skin.", "Pubmed ID": "17012259", "Reference": "FASEB J 2006; 20, 2068-2080.", "Author": "Yamasaki K et al.
