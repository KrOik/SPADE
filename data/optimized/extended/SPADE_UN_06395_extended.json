Exemplified herein are the expression and use of retrocylin and protegrin. Disclosed herein are methods of engineering chloroplasts to express such antimicrobial peptides such that they are properly processed and active. Plants containing such chloroplasts are disclosed as well. The chloroplast expressed peptides are useful to delay, prevent or treat viral and bacterial infections."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_06395", "Sequence": "GFCWHVCAYRNGKRACYRRCN", "Sequence Length": 21, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 392 from Patent US 20110306750", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CRA", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEILMOPQSTU", "Basic Residues": 6, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 7, "Polar Residues": 17, "Positive Residues": 6, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 2563.97, "PI": 9.58, "Net Charge": 6, "Hydrophobicity": -0.75, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_06220", "Similarity": 0.9523809523809523, "Sequence": "GFCWHVCAYRNGKRVCYRRCN"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_06414", "Similarity": 0.9523809523809523, "Sequence": "GFCWNVCAYRNGKRACYRRCN"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_06430", "Similarity": 0.9523809523809523, "Sequence": "GFCWRVCAYRNGKRACYRRCN"}]}}}
