HeV F, once triggered by the receptor-bound G, undergoes multistep conformational changes leading to a six-helix bundle (6HB) structure that accomplishes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Peptides derived from the HRN and HRC regions of F are proposed to inhibit fusion by preventing F, after the initial triggering step, from forming the 7HB structure that is required for fusion.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Inhibition of hendra virus fusion.", "Pubmed ID": "16973588", "Reference": "J Virol. 2006 Oct;80(19)9837-49.", "Author": "Porotto M, Doctor L, Carta P, Fornabaio M, Greengard O, Kellogg GE, Moscona A.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16973588"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "SQD", "Absent Amino Acids": "CFGHOPRUW", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 5, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 24, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 5, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_14895", "Similarity": 0.9444444444444444, "Sequence": "PPVYTKDVDISSQISSMNQSLQQSKDYIKEAQKILDTVNPSL"}]}}}
