S1 is a dimethylbutyl-gamma-amino acid, D2 is beta-hydroxylated, T5 is dehydrated Thr, K6 is N-hydrxy-formylornithine, K9 is N-droxy-lactam of ornithine. A synthetic peptide something like this sequemce was found to be inactive, indicating the importance of chemical modification.  The peptide is heat and protease resistant.Activity:  It is active against MRSA (MB5393), MSSA (ATCC 29213) (MIC 8 ug/mL), VRE (MIC 12.5 ug/mL), A. baumannii MB5973 and K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (MIC50 16 ug/ml), and P. aeruginosa (MIC50 32064 ug/ml). Showed better activity when combined with antibiotics.  Binding to metal such as gold and gallium. It can smuggled into cell via the siderophore mechanism.Toxicity: Not hemo.lytic (data?).", "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_15251", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GCSANDACYFCDTRDNCKACDASDFCIKSDT"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_09347", "Similarity": 0.8, "Sequence": "TRSRKKNPFVANHLLKKIKKLNTKGEKAIIKTWSRKSTIIPIMIGHTIAIHNGKEHLPVYITDRMVGHKLGEFSPTLNFGGFAKNDNKSRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_01553", "Similarity": 0.75, "Sequence": "TGTG"}]}}}
