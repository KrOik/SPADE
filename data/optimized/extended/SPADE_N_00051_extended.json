In addition, this C-terminal ring system is stabilised by a short antiparallel beta sheet. A feature of the actagardine structure is the presence of two putative binding pockets.", "Formula": "C81H132N20O26S4", "Mass": 1930.29, "PI": 4.05, "Net Charge": -1, "Hydrophobicity": 1.41, "Half Life": "Mammalian:4.4 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "The molecule has a compact shape. Like mersacidin, this peptide inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding to lipid II.", "PTM": "Maturation of lantibiotics involves the enzymic conversion of Thr, and Ser into dehydrated AA and the formation of thioether bonds with cysteine. The 14-19 beta-methyllanthionine thioether bond is oxidized to a sulfoxide. This is followed by membrane translocation and cleavage of the modified precursor.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Sequence determination of actagardine, a novel lantibiotic, by homonuclear 2D NMR spectroscopy.", "Pubmed ID": "2211371", "Reference": "J Antibiot (Tokyo). 1990 Sep;43(9)1082-1088.", "Author": "Kettenring JK, Malabarba A, VÂ©key K, Cavalleri B.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2211371"}, {"Title": "The three-dimensional solution structure of the lantibiotic murein-biosynthesis-inhibitor actagardine determined by NMR.", "Pubmed ID": "9219543", "Reference": "Eur J Biochem. 1997 Jun 15;246(3)809-819.", "Author": "Zimmermann N, Jung G.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9219543"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CTA", "Absent Amino Acids": "DFHKMNOPQRUY", "Basic Residues": 0, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 8, "Polar Residues": 12, "Positive Residues": 0, "Negative Residues": 1, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06163", "Similarity": 0.9473684210526315, "Sequence": "SSGWVCTLTIECGTVICAC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11360", "Similarity": 0.9473684210526315, "Sequence": "ASSGWVCTLTIECGTVICACR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05504", "Similarity": 0.8947368421052632, "Sequence": "ASGWVCTLTIECGTLVCAC"}]}}}
