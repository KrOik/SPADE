Development of new AMPs is arduous due to the practical limitations of classical protein-based discovery approaches. A high throughput bioinformatics approach is described which is able to confirm identification of known AMPs from the North American bullfrog ( Rana ( Lithobates ) catesbeiana ) genome, and a bioinformatics approach is used to develop new AMPs. The described AMPs exhibit antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis via microtitre broth dilution assays, indicating broader efficacy."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_13689", "Sequence": "IQRLPVIVILPSLYCVICRKK", "Sequence Length": 21, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 61 from Patent US 2022/0125873", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "ILV", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADEFGHMNOTUW", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 12, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 2455.12, "PI": 9.85, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": 1.02, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13688", "Similarity": 0.9047619047619048, "Sequence": "IQRLPVIVILPSLYCVICRTC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06386", "Similarity": 0.5454545454545454, "Sequence": "IVILPPLPIFG"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07358", "Similarity": 0.5454545454545454, "Sequence": "IVILPPLPIFG"}]}}}
