GRAVY: 1.64; Mol W: 1762.166; Mol formula:C86H140N18O21; Mol Ex coeff: 0.Activity: Oncocin is particularly active against Gram-negative bacteria E. coli 8 strains (MIC 0.5-8 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa 8 strains (MIC 2-8 ug/ml) and K. pneumoniae 6 strains (MIC 0.25-8 ug/ml), A. baumannii 5 strains (MIC 0.5-2 ug/ml), E. cloacae (MIC 0.125-4 ug/ml), P. vulgaris (MIC 4 ug/ml), and Stenotrophomonas (MIC 8-32 ug/ml).Structure: The 3D structure for the complex between oncocin and a portion of the E. coli heat shock protein has been determined by X-ray crystallography.You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB. The AMP was found to bind to the beta-strand region of the protein (Knappe D et al. 2011 ChemBioChem 12:874). However, it was not clear how this binding kills bacteria. DnaK null mutants are still susceptible to oncocin (Krizan et al., 2014).MOA:bacteria: More recently, it is demonstrated that oncocins can also bind the 50S subunit of the 70S ribosome, thereby providing a more likely mechanism that inhibits protein synthesis (Krizsan A et al., 2015).You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structureherein the PDB.  Onc112 (seq VDKPPYLPRPRPPRrIYNr-NH2, in which r denotes d-arginine) bound to the 70S ribosome with residues 1-12 binding to the exit tunnel via its N-terminal 14 residues.Derivatives: oncocin has been further engineered (Shaikh et al., 2023) by using non-standard amino acids. Onc72, with a sequence VDKPPYLPRPRPPROIYNO-NH2 (O=orinithine), is highly efficient in systemic septicaemia infection models with E. coli ATCC25922, a carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae strain, and in a Murine Thigh Infection Model of K. pneumoniae ATCC43816 (Knappe D et al., 2015 Peptide Sci 104: 707-711).Interestingly, D-amino acids can be partially incorporated to confer other desired properties (e.g., serum stability) to the peptide without sacrificing peptide activity (Gan et al., 2024). Up to 9 C-terminal residues can be replaced with D-amino acids.  In contrast, full sequence stereo-randomization to sr-Onc abolished ribosome binding, similar to the case for the enantiomer D-Onc and further diastereomers containing D-residues in the ribosome binding stretch, such as DL7-Onc. For other derivatives, please refer to the ref above. D-amino acid incorporated peptides are resistant to serum degradation.Updated 10/2024", "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_18753", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ATCDLLSPFKVGHAACALHCIALGRRGGWCDGRAVCNCRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_13411", "Similarity": 0.975, "Sequence": "ATCDLLSPFKVGHAACALHCIAMGRRGGWCDGRAVCNCRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_13956", "Similarity": 0.9, "Sequence": "ATCDLLSPFKVGHAACAAHCIARGKRGGWCDGRAVCNCRK"}]}}}
