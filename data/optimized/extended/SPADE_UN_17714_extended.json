The CTP of this invention exhibits a transduction potential identical or higher than the conventional protein transduction, PTD, and a strong tendency to remain in the cytoplasm, so that it is very useful in inducing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and a drug delivery system (DDS) targeting cytoplasm."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17714", "Sequence": "YEREARRAARR", "Sequence Length": 11, "Peptide Name": "CTP506", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RAE", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDFGHIKLMNOPQSTUVW", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 9, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 1433.58, "PI": 11.42, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": -2.31, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_10933", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ARR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_11155", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ARRWFKFL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_13107", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ARRLGMNPWKTPPAKPKGSK"}]}}}
