The inventive peptides are useful to control pathological angiogenesis, such as occurs in cancer and other diseases. The peptides are based on a combination of basic residues contained within Exon 6 of human placental growth factor (PIGF), coupled at the carboxyl terminus to either Exon 8 of VEGF165 or Exon 7 of PIGF. The peptides behave as antagonists of VEGF165 signaling through a mechanism that involves competition for VEGF165 binding at either the VEGFR-2/NP-1 complex or NP-1, without affecting VEGF signaling through other pathways. This binding is sufficient to attenuate pathological angiogenesis such as occurs in tumor growth."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_16160", "Sequence": "RRREKQRPCDKPRR", "Sequence Length": 14, "Peptide Name": "P6V8-8N (SEQ ID NO:14 for Patent US 200", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RKP", "Absent Amino Acids": "AFGHILMNOSTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 8, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 2, "Polar Residues": 10, "Positive Residues": 8, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 1881.18, "PI": 11.71, "Net Charge": 6, "Hydrophobicity": -3.29, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_04933", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "PRRRK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06994", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "ERKKRRRE"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08802", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RRRWIVVIWRRR"}]}}}
