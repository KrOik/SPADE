The CTP of this invention exhibits a transduction potential identical or higher than the conventional protein transduction, PTD, and a strong tendency to remain in the cytoplasm, so that it is very useful in inducing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and a drug delivery system (DDS) targeting cytoplasm."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17723", "Sequence": "CWKKK", "Sequence Length": 5, "Peptide Name": "AlkCWK3 (SEQ ID NO:4)", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KCW", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADEFGHILMNOPQRSTUVY", "Basic Residues": 3, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 1, "Polar Residues": 4, "Positive Residues": 3, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 691.88, "PI": 9.79, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": -2.02, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_12507", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "CWKKKC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_12521", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "CWKKKKKKWWC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_12534", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "CWKKKKKWC"}]}}}
