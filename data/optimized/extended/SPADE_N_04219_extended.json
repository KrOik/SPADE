In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_04219", "Sequence": "MRLHHLLLVLFFLVLSAGSGFTQGIRSRRSCHRNKGVCALTRCPRNMRQIGTCFGPPVKCCRKK", "Sequence Length": 64, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 87 from Patent US 20080269122", "Source": "Capra hircus", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RLC", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEOUWY", "Basic Residues": 16, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 25, "Polar Residues": 39, "Positive Residues": 16, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 7257.73, "PI": 11.49, "Net Charge": 16, "Hydrophobicity": -0.04, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03220", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "SRRSCHRNKGVCALTRCPRNMRQIGTCFGPPVKCCRKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05756", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "SRRSCHRNKGVCALTRCPRNMRQIGTCFGPPVKCCR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03429", "Similarity": 0.875, "Sequence": "MRLHHLLLALFFLVLSAGSGFTQGIINHRSCYRNKGVCAPARCPRNMRQIGTCHGPPVKCCRKK"}]}}}
