Fungicidal concentrations are similar. Can rapidly kill C. tropicalis at 10 uM.Also inhibited C. tropicalis biofilms:fungi formation. Disrupted preformed biofilms (61.9% at MIC and 73.4% at 10xMIC.Toxicity: murine RAW 264.7 (IC50 69.2 uM).Synergy:antibiotic: killed C. tropicalis ATCC 750 (FICI 0.123) and C. gattii AFLP4 (FICI 0.069) strains synergistically with commercial antibiotic amphotericin B.MOA:fungi: damage membranes via permeabilization. Activity is retained in the presence of RPMI-1640, D-Sorbitol (cell wall), but reduced by Ergosterol (memrbane).Animal model:wax moth: the peptide treated up to 100 uM showed protective effect on Galleria mellonella.
