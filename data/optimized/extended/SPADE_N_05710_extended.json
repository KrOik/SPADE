Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_05710", "Peptide Name": "Mastoparan-L (MP-L; insects, arthropods, invertebrates, animals)", "Source": "Vespula lewisii (Korean yellow-jacket isp) (Vespula flaviceps lewisii)", "Family": "Belongs to the tetradecapeptide family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "INLKALAALAKKIL", "Sequence Length": 14, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01514"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "[Ref.27423268]Gram-positive bacteria:Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC=12.5 μM), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC=25 μM);Gram-negative bacteria:Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (MIC=25 μM), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC=50 μM), Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC=12.5 μM), Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 (MIC=2.7 μM)", "Hemolytic Activity": "[Ref.27423268]40% hemolysis at 10μM against rat red blood cells", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C70H130N18O16", "Mass": 1479.89, "PI": 10.3, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": 1.16, "Half Life": "Mammalian:20 hourYeast:30 minE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Mast cell degranulating peptide.
