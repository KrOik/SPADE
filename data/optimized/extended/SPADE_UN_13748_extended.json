In addition, the present disclosure provides a preparation method and two applications of the acid-activated CSP targeted antimicrobial peptide. For the acid-activated CSP targeted antimicrobial peptide provided by the present disclosure, CSP target molecules can be utilized to enhance the selectivity of the antimicrobial peptide and the aggregation of the antimicrobial peptide on the surface of SM bacteria, meanwhile 2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride 10 (DMMAn) is utilized to protect the amino groups so as to decrease the toxicity of the antimicrobial peptide melittin. When such a CSP targeted antimicrobial peptide gets into decayed tooth, it may be activated by acidic conditions in the microenvironment, thus exhibiting an antimicrobial activity. 15 FIG. 1 1/1"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_13748", "Sequence": "CIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISWIKRKRQQ", "Sequence Length": 27, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 1 from Patent AU 2021100565A4", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LIK", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEFHMNOUY", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 15, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 2893.54, "PI": 11.11, "Net Charge": 5, "Hydrophobicity": 0.38, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08918", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GLPALISWIKRKRQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08920", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GLPALISWIKRKR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_27129", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GLPALISWIKRKRQ"}]}}}
