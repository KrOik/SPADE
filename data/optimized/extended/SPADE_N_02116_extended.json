It blocks mechanosensitive ion channels (also named stretch-activated channels or SACs), without having effect on whole-cell voltage-sensitive currents. Acts by partitioning into the membrane and perturbing the interface between the channel and the lipid bilayer without necessarily being in physical contact with the channel. Inhibits atrial fibrillation as well as the membrane motor of outer hair cells at low doses. GsMTx-4 exhibites antimicrobial properties and was more active against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria.", "Tissue specificity": "Expressed by the venom gland.", "Miscellaneous": "This toxin does not inhibit potassium channels Kv1.1/KCNA1 (IC50>85 µM), Kv1.4/KCNA4 (IC50>85 µM) and Kv11.3/KCNH7 (IC50=53 µM).", "PTM": "Contains three disulfide bonds.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Solution structure of GsMTx-4, a peptide blocker of cation-selective stretch-activated channels.", "Pubmed ID": "PubMed ID is not available", "Reference": "Submitted (MAY-2002) to the PDB data bank", "Author": "Jung HJ, Lee CW, Earm YE, Kim JI.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=PubMed ID is not available"}, {"Title": "Solution structure of peptide toxins that block mechanosensitive ion channels.", "Pubmed ID": "12082099", "Reference": "J Biol Chem. 2002 Sep 13;277(37)34443-50.", "Author": "Oswald RE, Suchyna TM, McFeeters R, Gottlieb P, Sachs F.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12082099"}, {"Title": "Identification of a peptide toxin from Grammostola spatulata spider venom that blocks cation-selective stretch-activated channels.", "Pubmed ID": "10779316", "Reference": "J Gen Physiol. 2000 May;115(5)583-598.", "Author": "Suchyna TM, Johnson JH, Hamer K, Leykam JF, Gage DA, Clemo HF, Baumgarten CM, Sachs F.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10779316"}, {"Title": "Lipid membrane interaction and antimicrobial activity of GsMTx-4, an inhibitor of mechanosensitive channel.", "Pubmed ID": "163768", "Reference": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 Feb 10;340(2)633-638.", "Author": "Jung HJ, Kim PI, Lee SK, Lee CW, Eu YJ, Lee DG, Earm YE, Kim JI.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=163768"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CKF", "Absent Amino Acids": "AHIMOQTUVY", "Basic Residues": 7, "Acidic Residues": 3, "Hydrophobic Residues": 12, "Polar Residues": 18, "Positive Residues": 7, "Negative Residues": 3, "Similar Sequences": []}}}
