This indicated that sonorensin, produced initially as a protoxin, was posttransitionally modified to active bacteriocin. The purified sonorensin was also found to be heat stable, stable at low temperature, biologically active over a wide pH range, and not affected in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants, and reducing agents. However, sonoresin was protease-sensitive.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Sonorensin an antimicrobial peptide, belonging to the heterocycloanthracin subfamily of bacteriocins, from a new marine isolate, Bacillus sonorensis MT93.", "Pubmed ID": "24610839", "Reference": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 2014 May;80(10)2981-90.", "Author": "Chopra L, Singh G, Choudhary V, Sahoo DK.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24610839"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CSG", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEFIKLNOPQRTUVY", "Basic Residues": 7, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 14, "Polar Residues": 36, "Positive Residues": 7, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17039", "Similarity": 0.625, "Sequence": "SARNSCWS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17006", "Similarity": 0.5, "Sequence": "CNSCWSDK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17040", "Similarity": 0.5, "Sequence": "RNSCWSKD"}]}}}
