It also showed  a  protective effect in mouse models of oropharyngeal candidiasis, venous catheter and systemic C. albicans infection. Animal model:rats: It  showed  a  protective effect in a rat model of venous catheter infection.Half-life in vitro:serum: about 40% remaining after 4 h of incubation in 10% serum, 10% remaining after 24 h. Hence, more stable than the parent EntV bacteriocin. cf: 12aa-D, made of D-amino acids, had ~35% left after 24 h incubation in 10% serum. The D-form retained antifungal activity.Peptide engineering: When (i, i+7) stapled peptide is made. 60% peptide left after 24 h incubation. Activity retained as well.SAR: It is as active as EntV. A change of the Cys to a Ser in this 12mer disrupted peptide activity. But this did not happen when Cys is alkylated. Further truncation to 11mer and 10mer reduced peptide activity and the 9mer lost activity. Although the L and D-forms of the peptide showed different stability in human serum, they equally protected C. elegans infected with C. albicans (D=L in vivo): Animal model:Caenorhabditis elegans.", "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05540", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LGSCVANKIKDEFFAMISISAIVKAAQKKAWKELAVTVLRFAKANGLKTNAIIVAGQLALWAVQCGLS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_14324", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "TNAIIVAGQLALWAVQCGLS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_14325", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "AIIVAGQLALWAVQCG"}]}}}
