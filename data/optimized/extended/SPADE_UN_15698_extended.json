The inventors developed a novel chimeric peptide targeting cancer cells which overexpress EGFR or the like using a binding peptide such as a peptide sequence binding to EGFR, and a lytic peptide sequence, thereby solving such an object. Particularly, by using a chimeric peptide including an EGF receptor-binding peptide or the like and a cytotoxic peptide, this object was solved."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_15698", "Sequence": "GRVPYPRGGLLKLLKKLLKKLLKL", "Sequence Length": 24, "Peptide Name": "Sema3A(aa371-377) -nLytic", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LKG", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFHIMNOQSTUW", "Basic Residues": 8, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 10, "Positive Residues": 8, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 2745.53, "PI": 11.3, "Net Charge": 8, "Hydrophobicity": 0.01, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11038", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "NYQWVPYQGRVPYPR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11053", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "NYQWVPYQGRVPYPRGGLLKLLKKLLKKLLKL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_15698", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GRVPYPRGGLLKLLKKLLKKLLKL"}]}}}
