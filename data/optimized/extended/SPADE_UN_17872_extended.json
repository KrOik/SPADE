Specifically, the invention relates to an isolated polypeptide, the amino acid sequence of which is that one or more amino acids in a mother sequence are removed, or one or more amino acids in the mother sequence are replaced by L-type amino acids or D-type amino acids with the same number, wherein the mother sequence is SEQ ID NO. 1, SEQ ID NO. 62 or SEQ ID NO. 63; and the polypeptide has activity of blocking alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChR. The polypeptide can specifically block alpha 9 alpha 10nAChR, and has good application prospect in the aspects of preparing analgesic drugs, drugs for treating mental diseases and cancers, neuroscience tool drugs and the like."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17872", "Sequence": "RAPYDRRRRY", "Sequence Length": 10, "Peptide Name": "Î”10-19[S2A]GeXIVA", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RYA", "Absent Amino Acids": "CEFGHIKLMNOQSTUVW", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 8, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 1408.57, "PI": 11.44, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": -2.84, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11064", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LFGRAP"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11073", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "DLFGRAP"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_17841", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "TCRSSGRYCRAPYDRRRRYCRRITDACV"}]}}}
