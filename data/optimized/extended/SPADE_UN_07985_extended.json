The peptides, designated bovine granulocyte peptide A (BGP-A) and murine granulocyte peptide A (MGP-A) were purified to homogeneity from peripheral blood granulocytes. The amino acid and nucleotide sequence of BGP-A and MGP-A are also provided. A synthetic version of BGP-A and MGP-A is also provided. The purified BGP-A peptide is shown to have antimicrobial activity indistinguishable from that of natural BGP-A. Synthetic carboxamidated analogs of BGP-A (BGP-A-amide) and MGP-A (MGP-A-amide) are also provided."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_07985", "Sequence": "YQVIQSWEHWRE", "Sequence Length": 12, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 7 from Patent US 6696559", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "EQW", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDFGKLMNOPTU", "Basic Residues": 2, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 5, "Polar Residues": 7, "Positive Residues": 2, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 1660.79, "PI": 5.55, "Net Charge": 0, "Hydrophobicity": -1.41, "Similar Sequences": []}}}
