This allows selection of appropriate tumor targeting peptides for treatment of a given cancer, whereby subsequent agents provide more targeted delivery of arsenic to the tumor microenvironment."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17829", "Sequence": "CLSRYLDQC", "Sequence Length": 9, "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CLD", "Absent Amino Acids": "AEFGHIKMNOPTUVW", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 3, "Polar Residues": 6, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 1100.27, "PI": 5.82, "Net Charge": 0, "Hydrophobicity": -0.11, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03723", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KRCWKGQGACQTYCTRQETYMHLCPDASLCCLS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03724", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KRCWNGQGACRTFCTRQETFMHLCPDASLCCLS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_18111", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "VSDSECLSRY"}]}}}
