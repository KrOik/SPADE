In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03278", "Peptide Name": "Androctonus defensin (4 kDa defensin; Arthropods, animals)", "Source": "Androctonus australis (Sahara scorpion)", "Family": "Belongs to the invertebrate defensin family (Type 2 subfamily)", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "GFGCPFNQGACHRHCRSIRRRGGYCAGLFKQTCTCYR", "Sequence Length": 37, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P56686", "http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P81618"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "Gram-negative bacterium:Escherichia coli;Gram-positive bacterium:Micrococcus luteus.", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C177H273N63O46S6", "Mass": 4211.85, "PI": 9.69, "Net Charge": 9, "Hydrophobicity": -0.58, "Half Life": "Mammalian:30 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Characterization of novel cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides from scorpion blood.", "Pubmed ID": "8939880", "Reference": "J Biol Chem. 1996 Nov 22;271(47)29537-29544.", "Author": "Ehret-Sabatier L, Loew D, Goyffon M, Fehlbaum P, Hoffmann JA, van Dorsselaer A, Bulet P.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8939880"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CGR", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEMOUVW", "Basic Residues": 9, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 10, "Polar Residues": 25, "Positive Residues": 9, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02131", "Similarity": 0.972972972972973, "Sequence": "GFGCPFNQGACHRHCRSIRRRGGYCAGLIKQTCTCYRN"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03258", "Similarity": 0.9459459459459459, "Sequence": "GFGCPLNQGACHRHCRSIRRRGGYCAGFFKQTCTCYRN"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_15923", "Similarity": 0.9459459459459459, "Sequence": "GFGCPFNQGACHRHCRSIGRRGGYCAGLFKQTCTCYSR"}]}}}
