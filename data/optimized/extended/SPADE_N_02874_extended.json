Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02874", "Peptide Name": "Crabrolin (Insects, animals)", "Source": "Vespa crabro (European hornet)", "Family": "Not found", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "FLPLILRKIVTAL", "Sequence Length": 13, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01518"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti Mammalian cells"], "Target Organism": "No MICs found in DRAMP database", "Hemolytic Activity": "[Ref.6206053] Hemolysis is 20% of total at 10Âµg/ml against guinea pig red blood cell.", "Cytotoxicity": "No cytotoxicity information found in the reference(s) presented", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Linear", "N-terminal Modification": "Free", "C-terminal Modification": "Amidation", "Stereochemistry": "L", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C74H129N17O15", "Mass": 1496.92, "PI": 11.0, "Net Charge": 2, "Hydrophobicity": 1.72, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1.1 hourYeast:3 minE.coli:2 min", "Function": "Mast cell degranulating peptide.
