The present invention relates to novel antimicrobial peptides and derivatives thereof as well as the beta-defensin genes encoding the peptides. The invention further relates to methods of use of the peptides including a method of inhibiting microbial growth by administering an effective amount of the peptide alone or in combination with other antimicrobial agents or antibiotics."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03699", "Sequence": "TVCLMQQGHCRLFMCRSGERKGDICSDPWNRCCVP", "Sequence Length": 35, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 25 from Patent US 20030176652", "Source": "Mus musculus", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CRG", "Absent Amino Acids": "AOUY", "Basic Residues": 6, "Acidic Residues": 3, "Hydrophobic Residues": 11, "Polar Residues": 20, "Positive Residues": 6, "Negative Residues": 3, "Mass": 4030.73, "PI": 8.31, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": -0.33, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02960", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "PGDIPPGIRNTVCLMQQGHCRLFMCRSGERKGDICSDPWNRCCVPYSVKDRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02984", "Similarity": 0.9142857142857143, "Sequence": "DIPPGIRNTVCFMQRGHCRLFMCRSGERKGDICSDPWNRCCVSSSIKNR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05075", "Similarity": 0.9142857142857143, "Sequence": "MKVLLLFAVFFCLVQRNSGDIPPGIRNTVCFMQRGHCRLFMCRSGERKGDICSDPWNRCCVSSSIKNR"}]}}}
