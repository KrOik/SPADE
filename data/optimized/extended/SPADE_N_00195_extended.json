TfxB, TfxD and TfxF are all required for this processing.The chromophore is probably a six-membered ring derived from the cyclization of Gln-38. Maturation of thiazole and oxazole containing antibiotics involves the enzymic condensation of a Cys, Ser or Thr with the alpha-carbonyl of the preceding amino acid to form a thioether or ether bond, then dehydration to form a double bond with the alpha-amino nitrogen. Thiazoline or oxazoline rings are dehydrogenated to form thiazole or oxazole rings.", "Biophysicochemical properties": "pH dependence (Sensitive to extremes of pH); Temperature dependence (Thermostable).", "Literature": [{"Title": "DNA sequence and mutational analysis of genes involved in the production and resistance of the antibiotic peptide trifolitoxin.", "Pubmed ID": "8509324", "Reference": "J Bacteriol. 1993 Jun;175(12)3693-3702.", "Author": "Breil BT, Ludden PW, Triplett EW.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8509324"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "GAC", "Absent Amino Acids": "EFHKLMNOPTUWY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 3, "Polar Residues": 6, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 1, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00101", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KYYGNGVTCGLHDCRVDRGKATCGIINNGGMWGDIG"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03217", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "DTHISEKIIDCNDIG"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06157", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MDNKVAKNVEVKKGSIKATFKAAVLKSKTKVDIGGSRQGCVA"}]}}}
