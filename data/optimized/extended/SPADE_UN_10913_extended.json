In particular, novel engineered hybrid insecticidal proteins (eHIPs) having toxicity to at least corn rootworm are provided. By fusing unique combinations of complete or partial variable regions and conserved blocks of at least two different Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry proteins or a modified Cry proteins an eHIP having activity against corn rootworm is designed. Nucleic acid molecules encoding the novel eHIPs are also provided. Methods of making the eHIPs and methods of using the eHIPs and nucleic acids encoding the eHIPs of the invention, for example in transgenic plants to confer protection from insect damage are also disclosed."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_10913", "Sequence": "MCAGIRP", "Sequence Length": 7, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 130 from Patent US 20100017914", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Insecticidal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "ACG", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEFHKLNOQSTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 3, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 746.94, "PI": 8.0, "Net Charge": 1, "Hydrophobicity": 0.6, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06006", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "IRPIPFIPRGGKT"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06011", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "IRPVPFFPPVHAKKVFPLH"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_10952", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "IRPRPPRLPRPRPRPLPYPRP"}]}}}
