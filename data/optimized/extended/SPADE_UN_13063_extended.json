The present inventive methodology is able to allow tuning of a range of structural and functional properties such as pore size and selectively targeting membranes with specific lipid compositions. The present inventive methods will ultimately allow de novo design of membrane-active peptides for a wide range of biomedical applications, including for example, antimicrobial agents."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_13063", "Sequence": "GLDDLLKALLKAAGW", "Sequence Length": 15, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 8 from Patent WO", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LAD", "Absent Amino Acids": "CEFHIMNOPQRSTUVY", "Basic Residues": 2, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 9, "Polar Residues": 5, "Positive Residues": 2, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 1583.87, "PI": 5.96, "Net Charge": 0, "Hydrophobicity": 0.53, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_11495", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LLK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_11860", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "AAGWGLRRLLKYGKRS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_19424", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "AAGWGLRRLLKYGKRS"}]}}}
