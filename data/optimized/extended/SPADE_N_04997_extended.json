The invention provides modified Bt Cry4Ba and Cry19Aa proteins, or mutant toxins, which have toxicity-enhancing sequence modifications at one or more positions within the amino acid sequence of the protein. The invention also provides polynucleotides encoding modified Cry4Ba and Cry19Aa proteins. The invention also provides insecticidal compositions comprising mutant toxins with a new or broadened insecticidal spectrum, and insecticidal compositions comprising polynucleotides encoding the modified Cry4Ba and Cry19Aa proteins."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_04997", "Sequence": "SIAALEAALTRDVHLFTWLKRVDFWTNTIYQDLRFLSANKIGFSYTNSSAMQESGIYGSSGFGSNLTHQIQLNSNVYKTSITDTSSPSNRVT", "Sequence Length": 92, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 7 from Patent US 20050124803", "Source": "Bacillus thuringiensis", "Biological Activity": ["Insecticidal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "STL", "Absent Amino Acids": "COU", "Basic Residues": 9, "Acidic Residues": 6, "Hydrophobic Residues": 37, "Polar Residues": 58, "Positive Residues": 9, "Negative Residues": 6, "Mass": 10243.23, "PI": 8.08, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": -0.26, "Similar Sequences": []}}}
