The inventors developed a novel chimeric peptide targeting cancer cells which overexpress EGFR or the like using a binding peptide such as a peptide sequence binding to EGFR, and a lytic peptide sequence, thereby solving such an object. Particularly, by using a chimeric peptide including an EGF receptor-binding peptide or the like and a cytotoxic peptide, this object was solved."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11048", "Sequence": "WDLAWMFRLPVG", "Sequence Length": 12, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 39 from Patent US 20110319336", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LWA", "Absent Amino Acids": "CEHIKNOQSTUY", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 9, "Polar Residues": 3, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 1490.77, "PI": 5.84, "Net Charge": 0, "Hydrophobicity": 0.54, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_26370", "Similarity": 0.8, "Sequence": "KLPVGSLCSVD"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02485", "Similarity": 0.75, "Sequence": "LPVNSPMNKGDTEVMKCIVEVISDTLSKPSPMPVSKECFETLRGDERILSILRHQNLLKELQDLALQGAKERTHQQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13353", "Similarity": 0.75, "Sequence": "TRSSAAGLAWPVGRVHRLLRK"}]}}}
