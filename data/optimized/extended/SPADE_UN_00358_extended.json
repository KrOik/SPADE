More specifically, the antibacterial and fungicidal peptide of the present invention, in which lysine and tryptophan dipeptide is repeated four times, shows excellent antibacterial activities with respect to gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and antibiotic-resistant strains by affecting the inner membrane of harmful microorganisms, has remarkable fungicidal activities with respect to pathogenic fungi and antibiotic-resistant fungi, and shows little cytotoxicity, and thus can be useful for a pharmaceutical composition, a cosmetic composition, agricultural chemicals, a food preservative, a cosmetic preservative, and a pharmaceutical preservative."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_00358", "Peptide Name": "(KW)3", "Source": "Synthetic construct (De novo design)", "Family": "Not found", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "KWKWKW", "Sequence Length": 6, "UniProt Entry": "No entry found", "Protein Existence": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antifungal"], "Target Organism": "Fungi:Fusarium solani, Fusarium oxysporum.", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C51H68N12O7", "Mass": 961.16, "PI": 10.3, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": -2.4, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1.3 hourYeast:3 minE.coli:2 min", "Function": "Possess antifungal activity.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Antifungal Activity of (KW)n or (RW)n Peptide against Fusarium solani and Fusarium oxysporum.", "Pubmed ID": "23203110", "Reference": "Int J Mol Sci. 2012; 13(11) 15042-15053.", "Author": "Gopal R, Na H, Seo CH, Park Y.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23203110"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KW", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFGHILMNOPQRSTUVY", "Basic Residues": 3, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 3, "Polar Residues": 3, "Positive Residues": 3, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_09107", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KKWKKWKKWKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_09108", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KLWKKWKKWKK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_09819", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "WPKWWKWKRRWGRKKAKKRRG"}]}}}
