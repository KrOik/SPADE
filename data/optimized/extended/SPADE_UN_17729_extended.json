It also relates to methods of using the system in diagnosis of diseases, as research tool and as a targeting system, a composition comprising the system and especially a pharmaceutical composition a material covered with the system and a material having the delivery systems into the material. Finally it relates to novel peptides."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17729", "Sequence": "LLOOLAAAALOOLL", "Sequence Length": 14, "Peptide Name": "Pepfect 14", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LAO", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEFGHIKMNPQRSTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 0, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 10, "Polar Residues": 4, "Positive Residues": 0, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05522", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LLLE"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07291", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LLLR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07293", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LLLRR"}]}}}
