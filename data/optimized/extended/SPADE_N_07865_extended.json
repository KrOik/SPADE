Integrates into cell membranes and has multiple effects, probably, as a result of its interaction with negatively charged phospholipids. It inhibits well known transport pumps such as the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase. Increases the permeability of cell membranes to ions, particularly Na(+) and indirectly Ca(2+), because of the Na(+)-Ca(2+)-exchange.", "Literature": [{"Title": "The structure of Apis dorsata melittin: phylogenetic relationships between honeybees as deduced from sequence data.", "Pubmed ID": "", "Author": "Kreil G."}], "Peptide Name": "Melittin (MEL_APIDO)", "Hemolytic Activity": [], "Frequent Amino Acids": "ILG", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDFHMNOUY", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 12, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 1, "Hydrophobicity": 0.28, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08918", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GLPALISWIKRKRQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08920", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GLPALISWIKRKR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_27129", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GLPALISWIKRKRQ"}]}}}
