The cDNA sequences for three of these peptides have been isolated, and the complete coding sequence is provided. This invention also discloses methods for producing recombinant peptides, as well as methods of utilizing these peptides as insecticidal agents."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_05018", "Sequence": "CISARYPCSNSKDCCSGNCGTFWTCFIRKDPCSKECLAP", "Sequence Length": 39, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 2 from Patent US 5688764", "Source": "Spider venom", "Biological Activity": ["Insecticidal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CSK", "Absent Amino Acids": "HMOQUV", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 3, "Hydrophobic Residues": 12, "Polar Residues": 25, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 3, "Mass": 4295.94, "PI": 8.2, "Net Charge": 2, "Hydrophobicity": -0.24, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05017", "Similarity": 0.9743589743589743, "Sequence": "CISARYPCSNSKDCCSGNCGTFWTCYIRKDPCSKECLAP"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05019", "Similarity": 0.8974358974358975, "Sequence": "CISARYPCSNSKDCCSGSCGIFWTCYLRKDPCSKECLAP"}]}}}
