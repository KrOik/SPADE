Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02571", "Peptide Name": "Protegrin-2 (Protegrin 2; PG-2; pigs, mammals, animals)", "Source": "Sus scrofa (Pig)", "Family": "Belongs to the cathelicidin family", "Gene": "NPG2", "Sequence": "RGGRLCYCRRRFCICV", "Sequence Length": 16, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P32195"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Antifungal", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "Gram-positive bacterium:Listeria moncyrogenes strain EGD (MIC>25 µg/ml);Gram-negative bacterium:Escherichia coli ML-35 (MIC>25 µg/ml).Yeast:Candida albicans strain 820 (MIC>25 µg/ml).", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C81H137N31O18S4", "Mass": 1961.41, "PI": 9.88, "Net Charge": 5, "Hydrophobicity": 0.04, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1 hourYeast:2 minE.coli:2 min", "Function": "Microbicidal activity.
