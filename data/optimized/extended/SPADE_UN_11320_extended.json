The present invention further concerns the use of such agents for the treatment of bacterial infections in animals, including man. The agents are derivatives of vancomycin-type antibiotics, of structure: V-L-W-X; wherein V is a glycopeptide moiety which inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis in bacteria; L is a linking group; W is a peptidic membrane-associating element such as an element based on naturally-occurring animal or bacterial peptide antibiotics; and X is hydrogen or a membrane-insertive element."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11320", "Sequence": "GIGAXLKXLTTGLPALXSWIXRKRQQ", "Sequence Length": 26, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 30 from Patent US 7078380", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LXG", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEFHMNOUVY", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 10, "Polar Residues": 11, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02602", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISWIKRKRQQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06727", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KIAKVALAKLGIGAVLKVLTTGL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07944", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MKFLVNVALVFMVVYISYIYAAPEPEPAPEPEAEADAEADPEAGIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISWIKRKRQQG"}]}}}
