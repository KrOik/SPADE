The coiled-coil structures made by the methods disclosed within this specification mimic all or a portion of the internal, trimeric coiled-coil motif contained within the fusogenic conformation of an enveloped virus membrane-fusion protein, particularly the internal coiled-coil domain of the HIV gp41 ectodomain. The HIV-derived, chimeric peptides disclosed comprise a non-HIV, soluble, trimeric form of a coiled-coil fused in helical phase to all or a portion of the N-helix of HIV gp41 and are covalently-stabilized in a homotrimeric or heterotrimeric coiled-coil structure through the formation of disulfide or chemoselective bonds between said peptides. The covalently-stabilized, HIV-derived, homotrimeric or heterotrimeric coiled-coil structures made by the methods disclosed herein represent a close mimetic of a HIV gp41 fusion intermediate and ar"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_10742", "Sequence": "LLQLTVWGIKQLQARILAVERYLK", "Sequence Length": 24, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 50 from Patent US 7811577", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antiviral"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LQA", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDFHMNOPSU", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 14, "Polar Residues": 13, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 2853.45, "PI": 10.28, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": 0.4, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_04802", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "TLTVQARQLLSGIVQQQNNLLRAIEAQQHLLQLTVWGIKQLQARILAVERYLKDQLLGI"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_09611", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "NNLLRAIEAQQHLLQLTVWGIKQLQARILAVERYLKDQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_09612", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GSTMGARSMTLTVQARQLLSGIVQQQNNLLRAIEAQQHLLQLT"}]}}}
