Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02538", "Peptide Name": "Polyphemusin-2 (Polyphemusin II; crabs, Arthropods, animals)", "Source": "Limulus polyphemus (Atlantic horseshoe crab)", "Family": "Belongs to the tachyplesin/polyphemusin family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "RRWCFRVCYKGFCYRKCR", "Sequence Length": 18, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P14216"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Antifungal"], "Target Organism": "Yeast:Candida albicans M9.", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "No cytotoxicity information found in the reference(s) presented", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Cyclic", "N-terminal Modification": "Free", "C-terminal Modification": "Amidation", "Stereochemistry": "L", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C108H164N36O21S4", "Mass": 2430.95, "PI": 10.1, "Net Charge": 7, "Hydrophobicity": -0.8, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1 hourYeast:2 minE.coli:2 min", "Function": "Significantly inhibits the growth of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.", "Tissue specificity": "Hemocytes.", "PTM": "Contains two disulfide bonds 4-17; 8-13.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Antimicrobial peptides, isolated from horseshoe crab hemocytes, tachyplesin II, and polyphemusins I and II chemical structures and biological activity.", "Pubmed ID": "2514185", "Reference": "J Biochem. 1989 Oct;106(4)663-668.", "Author": "Miyata T, Tokunaga F, Yonega T, Yoshikawa K, Iwanaga S, Niwa M, Takao T, Shimonishi Y.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2514185"}, {"Title": "Structure-activity relationships for the beta-hairpin cationic antimicrobial peptide polyphemusin I.", "Pubmed ID": "15134657", "Reference": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 2004 May 6;1698(2)239-250.", "Author": "Powers J.P, Rozek A, Hancock R.E.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15134657"}, {"Title": "Antimicrobial peptides, isolated from horseshoe crab hemocytes, tachyplesin II, and polyphemusins I and II: chemical structures and biological activity.", "Pubmed ID": "", "Author": "Iwanaga S.,Yoshikawa K.,Yonega T.,Tokunaga F.,Miyata T."}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RCF", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADEHILMNOPQSTU", "Basic Residues": 7, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 6, "Polar Residues": 14, "Positive Residues": 7, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00323", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RRWWRRWRRW"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00874", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RRWCRVCYGFCYRKCR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_21507", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "WRRWRRRWRRRWRRW"}]}}}
