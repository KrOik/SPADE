This is the first proline-rich AMP with a disulfide bond. Further styudies are needed to elucidate additional residues that might be oxidized or hydroxylated (i.e., P, Y), at least one arginine. Warning: there may be other modifications such as D-amino acids since the synthetic forms were inactive.Activity:  Active against both Gram+ (e.g. S. aureus LAC) and Gram- bacteria (e.g. E. coli ATCC 25922).MOA:  it appears to act on an intracellular target.
