Examples of antimicrobial agents are antimicrobial peptides such as lactoferricins and antimicrobial enzymes such as lysozyme and glucose oxidase, and examples of enzymes are endoglucanase, xylanase, phytase, protease, galactanase, mannanase, dextranase, alpha-galactosidase, pectate lyase, alpha-amylase and glucoamylase. A fusion product comprising the antimicrobial agent and the enzyme and a cleavable linker is novel, and can be used in animal feed and animal feed additives. The invention also describes the use of a protection domain wherein at least 50% of the amino acid residues comprised in the peptide protection domain are D (Asp) and/or E (Glu). The protection or quenching domain serves to temporarily and reversibly inactivate the antimicrobial peptide during the expression."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02560", "Peptide Name": "Antibacterial protein PR-39 (pigs, mammals, animals)", "Source": "Sus scrofa (Pig)", "Family": "Belongs to the cathelicidin family", "Gene": "PR39", "Sequence": "RRRPRPPYLPRPRPPPFFPPRLPPRIPPGFPPRFPPRFP", "Sequence Length": 39, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P80054", "http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9TR84"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "Gram-negative bacteria:Escherichia coli K12 D21 (MIC=0.3 µM), Escherichia coli Bd2221175 (MIC=0.3 µM), Salmonella typhimurium LT2 (MIC=1µM), Proteus vulgaris Pvll (MIC=300 µM), Pseudomonas aeruginosa OT97 (MIC=200 µM), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Acl 1 (MIC=3 µM).Gram-positive bacteria:Bacillus megaterium (MIC=0.3 µM), Bacillus subtilis (MIC=15 µM), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=200 µM), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC=2 µM).", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C229H345N69O41", "Mass": 4720.63, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 10, "Hydrophobicity": -1.31, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1 hourYeast:2 minE.coli:2 min", "Tissue specificity": "Small intestine and bone marrow.", "PTM": "Proline amide at P39.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Amino acid sequence of PR-39.
