Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_01031", "Peptide Name": "Bombinin-like peptide 1 (toads, amphibians, animals)", "Source": "Bombina orientalis (Oriental fire-bellied toad)", "Family": "Belongs to the bombinin family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "GIGASILSAGKSALKGLAKGLAEHFAN", "Sequence Length": 27, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P29002?"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Target Organism": "[Ref.1744108] 82% inhibition Neisseria meningitidis 118V C (MIC=20 µg/ml), 98% inhibition Neisseria meningitidis 15240 IAI(MIC=20 µg/ml), 85% inhibition Neisseria meningitidis 126E IC1(MIC=20 µg/ml), 98% inhibition Neisseria gonorrhoeoe F62 (MIC=20 µg/ml), 96% inhibition Neisseria Iactamica 15323(MIC=20 µg/ml), 100% inhibition Neisseria Iactamica 15215A(MIC=20 µg/ml), 98% inhibition Neisseria cinerea 15461 (MIC=20 µg/ml), Bacillus megaterium BmII(MIC=0.3 µM), Staphylococcus aureus Cowan1 (MIC=3.4 µM), Escherichia coli D21 (MIC=1.7 µM), Escherichia coli D22(MIC=1.5 µM), Yersinia pseudotubercolosis (MIC=0.8 µM), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15692(MIC=6.3 µM), Candida albicans(MIC=0.4 µM).", "Hemolytic Activity": "[Ref.1744108] No significant hemolytic activity against human red blood cell.", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "These peptides are cationic but otherwise differ considerably in such basic featuresa  st  heir size (Mr ~2300-4000), presence of disulfide bonds, and  structural motifs.", "Formula": "C115H193N33O34", "Mass": 2581.96, "PI": 9.7, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": 0.43, "Half Life": "Mammalian:30 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Has antimicrobial activity, but no significant hemolytic activity.
