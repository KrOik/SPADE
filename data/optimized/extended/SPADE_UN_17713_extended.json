The CTP of this invention exhibits a transduction potential identical or higher than the conventional protein transduction, PTD, and a strong tendency to remain in the cytoplasm, so that it is very useful in inducing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and a drug delivery system (DDS) targeting cytoplasm."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_17713", "Sequence": "YAREARRAARR", "Sequence Length": 11, "Peptide Name": "CTP505", "Source": "Synthetic", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RAE", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDFGHIKLMNOPQSTUVW", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 5, "Polar Residues": 10, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 1375.54, "PI": 11.83, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": -1.83, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_02025", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RLARIVVIRYAR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_02844", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "VWAKWWYAR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_12383", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "YQRVEQYVQRSYDAYRNYAR"}]}}}
