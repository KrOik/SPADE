Another object is to provide an antimicrobial agent which contains such an antimicrobial peptide. Namely, an antimicrobial peptide represented by a general formula (1) (Xa)n-S (1) wherein Xa of the formula (1) is a hydrophilic amino acid residue, n is an integer of from 1 to 6, two or more of the Xa may be the same or different from one another, S is a peptide represented by hydrophobic amino acid part-basic amino acid part-bridge part-basic amino acid part-hydrophobic amino acid part, and amino acid residue of the bridge part is selected from the group consisting of hydrophobic amino acids and neutral amino acids."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_01167", "Sequence": "RRRLLRKWWWKRLL", "Sequence Length": 14, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 3 from Patent US 20050171335", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RLW", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFGHIMNOPQSTUVY", "Basic Residues": 7, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 7, "Polar Residues": 7, "Positive Residues": 7, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 2066.55, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 7, "Hydrophobicity": -1.27, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02907", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "SRDLICLCRNRRCNRGELFYGTCAGPFLRCCRRRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02908", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "SRDLICLCRKRRCNRGELFYGTCAGPFLRCCRRRR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02991", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "FLRRSVSGFQECHSKGGYCYRYYCPRPHRRLGSCYPYAANCCRRRR"}]}}}
