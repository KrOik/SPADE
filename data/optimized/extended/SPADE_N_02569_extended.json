The invention also provides specific analogs or fragments of cathelicidin that function as agonists, as do endogenous cathelicidins, or as either dominant negatives or as inhibitors to endogenous cathelicidin or to other endogenous AMPs or that compete with pro-inflammatory agents or fragments of AMPs on cognate receptors without inducing disease."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02569", "Peptide Name": "Prophenin-1 (C6, PF-1; Pro-rich; pigs, mammals, animals)", "Source": "Sus scrofa (Pig)", "Family": "Belongs to the cathelicidin family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "AFPPPNVPGPRFPPPNFPGPRFPPPNFPGPRFPPPNFPGPRFPPPNFPGPPFPPPIFPGPWFPPPPPFRPPPFGPPRFP", "Sequence Length": 79, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P51524"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "Gram-positive bacterium:Listeria monocytogenes;Gram-negative bacterium:Escherichia coli.", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C440H589N103O85", "Mass": 8681.02, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 6, "Hydrophobicity": -0.8, "Half Life": "Mammalian:4.4 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Exerts antimicrobial activity.
