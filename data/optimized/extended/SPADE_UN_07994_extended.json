The present invention also relates to the useful vector for the DNA construct. The DNA construct according to the present invention comprises a first gene coding for entire, a part of or a derivative of purF gene and a second gene coding for antimicrobial peptide. According to the present invention, antimicrobial peptides can be mass-produced by the following steps: preparing an expression vector containing a DNA construct comprising a first gene coding for an entire, a part of or a derivative of purF gene and a second gene coding for antimicrobial peptide; transforming the bacterial host cells with the above-mentioned vector, culturing the transformed cell to express the above-mentioned DNA construct; and recovering the above antimicrobial peptide."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_07994", "Sequence": "MCGIVGIAGVMPVNQSIYDALTVLQHRGQDAAGIITIDANNCFRLRKANGLVSDVFEARHM", "Sequence Length": 61, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 74 from Patent US 6699689", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "AGI", "Absent Amino Acids": "OUW", "Basic Residues": 7, "Acidic Residues": 5, "Hydrophobic Residues": 30, "Polar Residues": 34, "Positive Residues": 7, "Negative Residues": 5, "Mass": 6572.56, "PI": 6.69, "Net Charge": 2, "Hydrophobicity": 0.29, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_07997", "Similarity": 0.9836065573770492, "Sequence": "MCGIVGIAGVMPVNQSIYDALTVLQHRGQDAAGIITIDANNCFRLRKANALVSDVFEARHM"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_07995", "Similarity": 0.9661016949152542, "Sequence": "MCGIVGIAGVMPVNQSIYDALTVLQHRGQDAAGIITIDANNCFRLRKANALVSDVFEAN"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_07996", "Similarity": 0.9508196721311475, "Sequence": "MCGIVGIAGVMPVNQSIYDALTVLQHRGQDAAGIITIDANNCFRLRKANALVSDVFEAAHAN"}]}}}
