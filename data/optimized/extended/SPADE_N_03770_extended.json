More specifically, it refers to a peptide called gomesin, with 18 amino acid residues, configured as a clamp-like structure consisting of two anti-parallel beta-folded sheets joined by a beta turn, containing four invariable residues of cystein forming two disulphide bridges, optionally configurable as a cyclic chain with closed edges."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03770", "Sequence": "XCRRLCYRQRCVTYCRGR", "Sequence Length": 18, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 19 from Patent US 20030186854", "Source": "Arachinid", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antiparasitic", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RCY", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADEFHIKMNOPSUW", "Basic Residues": 6, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 4, "Polar Residues": 15, "Positive Residues": 6, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03819", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "CRRLCYRQRCVTYCRG"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11753", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GCRRLCYRQRCVTYCRGR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11756", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KCRRLCYRQRCVTYCRGR"}]}}}
