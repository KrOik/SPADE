Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_03989", "Sequence": "GIGALSAKGALKGLAKGLAZHFAN", "Sequence Length": 24, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 49 from Patent US 20050260715", "Source": "Bombina variegata", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "AGL", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEMOPQRTUVWY", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 12, "Polar Residues": 12, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_01085", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GIGALSAKGALKGLAKGLAEHFAN"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07866", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GIGALSAKGALKGLAKGLAQHFAN"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_01031", "Similarity": 0.9565217391304348, "Sequence": "GIGASILSAGKSALKGLAKGLAEHFAN"}]}}}
