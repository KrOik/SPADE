The present invention also relates to the useful vector for the DNA construct. The DNA construct according to the present invention comprises a first gene coding for entire, a part of or a derivative of purF gene and a second gene coding for antimicrobial peptide. According to the present invention, antimicrobial peptides can be mass-produced by the following steps: preparing an expression vector containing a DNA construct comprising a first gene coding for an entire, a part of or a derivative of purF gene and a second gene coding for antimicrobial peptide; transforming the bacterial host cells with the above-mentioned vector, culturing the transformed cell to express the above-mentioned DNA construct; and recovering the above antimicrobial peptide."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_07993", "Sequence": "GRAGLQFPVGRLLRRLLRRLLR", "Sequence Length": 22, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 72 from Patent US 6699689", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LRG", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEHIKMNOSTUWY", "Basic Residues": 7, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 11, "Polar Residues": 10, "Positive Residues": 7, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 2617.2, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 7, "Hydrophobicity": -0.11, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00772", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RAGLQFPVGRLLRRLLRRLLR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_16899", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RAGLQFPVGRLLRRLLR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13370", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "AGLQFP"}]}}}
