The polypeptides according to the invention are effective against fungi, especially against fungi causing plant diseases, and against fungi colonizing agricultural products. The invention further discloses processes for preparing such polypeptides, and nucleic acids coding for such polypeptides. In addition, the invention relates to processes and preparations for treating plants using the polypeptides according to the invention, and to the use of the nucleic acids according to the invention for producing crops that are protected against damage from fungi."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_05976", "Sequence": "SHGY", "Sequence Length": 4, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 8 from Patent US 10266842", "Source": "Lucilia sericata", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "GHS", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFIKLMNOPQRTUVW", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 1, "Polar Residues": 3, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 462.46, "PI": 6.46, "Net Charge": 1, "Hydrophobicity": -1.43, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00479", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "IDVHDAMCYRSECTSVCDQICLSHGYTNGWYCGTFRLHTGCCCLKKKELNQIISPSKN"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03667", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MAVMKSRTVIVAAVLLAVVILSSLCPCYEAGGCTIGKPPKTPAPKRPCFSPYSEDHCDRQNCRFVCMSHGYSDGGWCDEREVRKMCCCYH"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03668", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MAVMKSRTVIVAAVLLAVVILSSLCPCYEAGGCIGKPPKTPAPKRPCFSPYSEDHCDRQNCRFVCMSHGYSDGGWCDEREVRKMCCCYH"}]}}}
