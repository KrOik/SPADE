Shows inhibitory activities against herpes simplex virus and immunopotentiating activities. Its antimicrobial activities are not very pronounced.", "PTM": "Maturation of lantibiotics involves the enzymic conversion of Thr, and Ser into dehydrated AA and the formation of thioether bonds with cysteine or the formation of dialkylamine bonds with lysine.
