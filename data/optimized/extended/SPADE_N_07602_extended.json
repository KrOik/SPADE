Exhibits diverse biological activities, such as hemorrhage, edema, antibacterial and antiparasitic activities, as well as regulation of platelet aggregation. Effects of snake L-amino oxidases on platelets are controversial, since they either induce aggregation or inhibit agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions (By similarity). This protein has an ability to induce hemolysis and apoptosis.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Apoptotic effect in the glioma cells induced by specific protein extracted from Okinawa Habu (Trimeresurus flavoviridis) venom in relation to oxidative stress.", "Pubmed ID": "R2003J0184", "Author": "Saito A.,Tsurushima H.,Hyodo A.,Yoshii Y.,Sun L.-K."}, {"Title": "Characterization of an apoptosis-inducing factor in Habu snake venom as a glycyrrhizin (GL)-binding protein potently inhibited by GL in vitro.", "Pubmed ID": "R1998J0278", "Author": "Nagata N.,Ito J.,Munakata H.,Shimoyama Y.,Abe Y."}], "Peptide Name": "L-amino-acid oxidase (OXLA_PROFL)", "Hemolytic Activity": [], "Frequent Amino Acids": "EDF", "Absent Amino Acids": "CGIKMOQSUVW", "Basic Residues": 3, "Acidic Residues": 7, "Hydrophobic Residues": 8, "Polar Residues": 8, "Positive Residues": 3, "Negative Residues": 7, "Hydrophobicity": -1.51, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_03223", "Similarity": 0.9, "Sequence": "ADDRNPLEECFRETDYEEFLEIARNGLKKT"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00179", "Similarity": 0.9, "Sequence": "ADDRNPLEECFRETDYEEFLEIAKNGLSTT"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02196", "Similarity": 0.85, "Sequence": "ADDRNPLEQCFRETDYEEFLEIARNNLKATSNPKHVVIVGAGMAGLSAAYVLSGGGHQVTV"}]}}}
