GRAVY: 0.0818; mol Wt: 2590.201; mol formula: C124H205N29O27S1; mol ex coeff: 11100.Activity: active against S. aureus NCTC 10788 or MRSA (MIC 4 uM), E. coli ATCC 8739 (MIC 8 uM), K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (MIC 16 uM), E. faecium NTCC 12697 (MIC 8 uM), and P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (MIC 32 uM).  Good at biofilm inhibition but poor at eradication. Effective against multiple cancer cell lines (IC50 1.73-5.375 uM).Toxicity: horse RBC: low hemolytic (HC50 8 uM).Structure: became helical in 50% TFE.SAR: The truncated 22-residue peptide was inactive. Amino acid substituion by replaccing 2 acidic D to K and one K to L made the peptide potent. Further substitution of 2A to 2W made the peptide toxic. These peptides reinforced the recurring theme that a proper balance of hydrophobic and basic charge residues in a peptide is important for selectivity and potency.", "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_26833", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GFMKTWKNVWKNVAATLLKLLK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05862", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KLLKHKLLVTLA"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_09624", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "LKLLKLL"}]}}}
