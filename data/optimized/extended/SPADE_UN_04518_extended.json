The gene construct of the present invention has a translationally coupled configuration of two independent and separate cistrons which encode an acidic peptide and a basic antimicrobial peptide, each having an opposite charge, under the control of a single promoter. The translationally coupled acidic peptide and basic antimicrobial peptide undergo charge-charge interaction simultaneously with expression thereof to neutralize the potential cytotoxicity of the antimicrobial peptide, resulting in prevention of antimicrobial peptide-mediated killing of host microorganisms. In addition, a conjugate of the acidic peptide and the antimicrobial peptide can be separated without chemical or enzymatic treatment. Therefore, it is possible to achieve easy mass pro"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_04518", "Sequence": "EEVE", "Sequence Length": 4, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 20 from Patent US 8003348", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "EV", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUWY", "Basic Residues": 0, "Acidic Residues": 3, "Hydrophobic Residues": 1, "Polar Residues": 1, "Positive Residues": 0, "Negative Residues": 3, "Mass": 504.49, "PI": 4.05, "Net Charge": -3, "Hydrophobicity": -1.57, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02535", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GQALNKLMPKIVSAIIYMIGQPNAGVTFLGHQCLVESTRQPDGFYTAKMWCTSWTSDNPIVGEGRSRVELEALKGSIRNFVQTASDYKKFTIEEVEDWIAS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05385", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MFTNPKIDGETAEKDWDFSSEEVEGEALFPLVDNKKSVRKYIFDSANMTNHDGDGEKGEEAFLKKILGEEYTGNVTEGNEETL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_01322", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MKTFSVAVAVVVVLACMFILESTAVPFSEVRTEEVESIDSPVGEHQQPGGTSMNLPMHFRFKRQSHLSLCRWCCNCCHNKGCGFCCKF"}]}}}
