Development of new AMPs is arduous due to the practical limitations of classical protein-based discovery approaches. A high throughput bioinformatics approach is described which is able to confirm identification of known AMPs from the North American bullfrog ( Rana ( Lithobates ) catesbeiana ) genome, and a bioinformatics approach is used to develop new AMPs. The described AMPs exhibit antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis via microtitre broth dilution assays, indicating broader efficacy."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_13668", "Sequence": "GLLDIIKKTGKTTGILMDTLKCCMTGRCPPSS", "Sequence Length": 32, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 40 from Patent US 2022/0125873", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "TGK", "Absent Amino Acids": "AEFHNOQUVWY", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 11, "Polar Residues": 15, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 3383.1, "PI": 9.06, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": 0.09, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13667", "Similarity": 0.9375, "Sequence": "GLLDIIKDTGKTTGILMDTLKCQMTGRCPPSS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13669", "Similarity": 0.6, "Sequence": "GLLDIIKTTGKDFAVKILDNLKCKLAGGCPP"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_13643", "Similarity": 0.5806451612903226, "Sequence": "GFLDIIKNLGKTFAGHMLDKIKCTIGTCPPSP"}]}}}
