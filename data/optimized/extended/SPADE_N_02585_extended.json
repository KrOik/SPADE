Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02585", "Peptide Name": "Neutrophil cationic peptide 2 (CP-2; GNCP-2; pigs, mammals, animals)", "Source": "Cavia porcellus (Guinea pig)", "Family": "Belongs to the alpha-defensin family", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "RRCICTTRTCRFPYRRLGTCLFQNRVYTFCC", "Sequence Length": 31, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P49112", "http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9R0Z5"], "Protein Existence": "Homology", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-", "Antifungal", "Antiviral"], "Target Organism": "Gram-negative bacterium:Escherichia coli;Gram-positive bacterium:Staphylococcus aureus.", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C164H262N54O41S6", "Mass": 3838.56, "PI": 9.8, "Net Charge": 7, "Hydrophobicity": -0.22, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1 hourYeast:2 minE.coli:2 min", "Function": "Has antibiotic, anti-fungi and antiviral activity.", "PTM": "Contains three disulfide bonds (By similarity).", "Literature": [{"Title": "Cloning and characterization of the guinea pig neutrophil cationic peptide-1 and -2 genes.", "Pubmed ID": "8173076", "Reference": "DNA Seq. 1993;4(2)123-128.", "Author": "Nagaoka I, Nonoguchi A, Yamashita T.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8173076"}, {"Title": "Synergistic actions of antibacterial neutrophil defensins and cathelicidins.", "Pubmed ID": "10738945", "Reference": "Inflamm Res. 2000 Feb;49(2)73-79.", "Author": "Nagaoka I, Hirota S, Yomogida S, Ohwada A, Hirata M.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10738945"}, {"Title": "Characterization of cDNA clones encoding guinea pig neutrophil cationic peptides.", "Pubmed ID": "", "Author": "Yamashita T.,Iwabuchi K.,Someya A.,Nagaoka I."}, {"Title": "Structure of the guinea pig neutrophil cationic peptide gene.", "Pubmed ID": "", "Author": "Yamashita T.,Iwabuchi K.,Someya A.,Nagaoka I."}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RCT", "Absent Amino Acids": "ADEHKMOSUW", "Basic Residues": 7, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 10, "Polar Residues": 23, "Positive Residues": 7, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08066", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MRTVPLFAACLLLTLMAQAEPLPRAADHSDTKMKGDREDHVAVISFWEEESTSLQDAGAGAGRRCICTTR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_07648", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RCICTTRTCRFPYRRLGTCLFQNRVYTFCC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02586", "Similarity": 0.967741935483871, "Sequence": "RRCICTTRTCRFPYRRLGTCIFQNRVYTFCC"}]}}}
