In particular, the present invention relates to methods of producing a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule (e.g., immunoglobulin or innate immune system receptor molecule) and a biocide (e.g., bactericidal enzymes) in transgenic animals (e.g., bovines) and in cell cultures. The present invention also relates to therapeutic and prophylactic methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in health care (e.g., human and veterinary), agriculture (e.g., animal and plant production), and food processing (e.g., beef carcass processing). The present invention also relates to methods of using a fusion protein comprising a microorganism targeting molecule and a biocide in various diagnostic applications in number of diverse fields such as"}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_04206", "Sequence": "ACTCRIGACVSGERLTGACGLNGRIYRLCCR", "Sequence Length": 31, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 50 from Patent US 20080269122", "Source": "Rattus norvegicus", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Antifungal"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "CGR", "Absent Amino Acids": "DFHKMOPQUW", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 10, "Polar Residues": 20, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 3276.89, "PI": 8.98, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": 0.32, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02983", "Similarity": 0.967741935483871, "Sequence": "ACYCRIGACVSGERLTGACGLNGRIYRLCCR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_08055", "Similarity": 0.967741935483871, "Sequence": "MRTLTLLITLLLLALHTQAESPQERAKAAPDQDMVMEDQDIFISFGGYKGTVLQDAVVKAGQACYCRIGACVSGERLTGACGLNGRIYRLCCR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02982", "Similarity": 0.7241379310344828, "Sequence": "CSCRTSSCRFGERLSGACRLNGRIYRLCC"}]}}}
