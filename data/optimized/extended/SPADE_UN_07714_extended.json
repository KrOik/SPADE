In particular, the proteins are derived from lentiviruses, primarily HIV and SIV. The peptides comprise arginine-rich sequences, which, when modeled for secondary structure, display a high amphipathicity and hydrophobic moment. They are highly inhibitory to microorganisms, while being significantly less active in regard to mammalian cells. As a result, the peptides of the invention may be defined as selective antimicrobial agents. The invention is also directed to antimicrobial peptides which are structural and functional analogs and homologs of the peptides and which exhibit selective inhibitory activity towards microorganisms. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the antimicrobial peptides of the invention and to methods for their use in inhibiting microbial growth and treatment of microbial infections."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_07714", "Sequence": "RVIEVVQGICRAIRHIPRRIRQGLERIL", "Sequence Length": 28, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 16 from Patent US 5714577", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "RIV", "Absent Amino Acids": "DFKMNOSTUWY", "Basic Residues": 8, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 15, "Positive Residues": 8, "Negative Residues": 2, "Mass": 3351.03, "PI": 11.88, "Net Charge": 6, "Hydrophobicity": 0.01, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_07710", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "RVIEVVQGICRAIRHIPRRIR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_07721", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "VVQGICRAIRHIPRRIR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_07724", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "VVQGICRAIRHIPRRIRGLERIL"}]}}}
