The strain of E. mundtii (ST4SA) produces an antimicrobial peptide which exhibits antimicrobial activity against a broad range of bacteria. The invention also provides an isolated nucleotide sequence which codes for the antimicrobial peptide (peptide ST4SA). Another aspect of the invention relates to a process for the production of a peptide of the invention which comprises cultivating Enterococcus mundtii strain ST4SA in a nutrient medium under micro-aerophilic conditions at a temperature of between 100 â„ƒ. and 45 â„ƒ., until a recoverable quantity of said peptide is produced, and recovering said peptide. The isolated peptide of the invention may be used as an antimicrobial agent in a liquid formulation or a gel formulation as a topical treatment and may also be used as an antimicrobial agent following encapsulation in a polymer."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_04435", "Sequence": "KYYGNGVSCNKKGCSVDWGKAIGIIGNNS", "Sequence Length": 29, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 17 from Patent US 7951385", "Source": "ENTEROCOCCUS MUNDTII ST4S", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "GKN", "Absent Amino Acids": "EFHLMOPQRTU", "Basic Residues": 4, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 9, "Polar Residues": 18, "Positive Residues": 4, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 3033.4, "PI": 9.19, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": -0.44, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00063", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KYYGNGVSCNKKGCSVDWGKAIGIIGNNSAANLATGGAAGWSK"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_00064", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KYYGNGVSCNKKGCSVDWGKAIGIIGNNSAANLATGGAAGWKS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_04433", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "MSQVVGGKYYGNGVSCNKKGCSVDWGKAIGIIGNNSAANLATGGAAGWKS"}]}}}
