These peptides were able to inhibit growth of both H. influenzae and Staphylococcal aureus. Thus, methods for treating bacterial infections, alone or in combination with traditional antibiotics, are envisioned."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_01044", "Sequence": "ASPTYRLYSASPASPASPASPLYS", "Sequence Length": 24, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 5 from Patent US 20050037972", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "SAP", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEFGHIKMNOQUVW", "Basic Residues": 1, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 15, "Polar Residues": 17, "Positive Residues": 1, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 2441.65, "PI": 8.54, "Net Charge": 1, "Hydrophobicity": -0.25, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_18201", "Similarity": 0.7777777777777778, "Sequence": "SPARASPAL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_10850", "Similarity": 0.5555555555555556, "Sequence": "MNLASPLIS"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11331", "Similarity": 0.5, "Sequence": "ASPMLVAYDA"}]}}}
