Cationic peptides are also effective when administered as therapeutic agents. A practical drawback in cationic peptide therapy, however, is the cost of producing the agents. The methods described herein provide a means to efficiently produce cationic peptides from recombinant host cells. These recombinantly-produced cationic peptides can be rapidly purified from host cell proteins using anion exchange chromatography."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02459", "Peptide Name": "Bactenecin 5 (mammals, animals)", "Source": "Bos taurus (Bovine)", "Family": "Not found", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "RFRPPIRRPPIRPPFYPPFRPPIRPPIFPPIRPPFRPPLRFP", "Sequence Length": 42, "UniProt Entry": "No entry found", "Protein Existence": "Not found", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "Gram-negative bacteria:Salmonella typhimurium (MIC=2-10 ÂµM), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli.", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C254H384N72O44", "Mass": 5150.22, "PI": 12.0, "Net Charge": 10, "Hydrophobicity": -0.8, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1 hourYeast:2 minE.coli:2 min", "Comments": "No comments found on DRAMP database", "Literature": [{"Title": "Amino acid sequences of two proline-rich bactenecins.
