The composition can also include an effective amount of at least one of a growth factor and a neuropeptide. The present invention also relates a method of treating an injury to a nervous system of an animal that includes the steps of identifying the injury to the nervous system and applying to the injury an effective amount of at least one of antimicrobial peptide and a substance having an antimicrobial peptide effect. The method can also include applying an effective amount of one or more trophic factors selected from the group consisting of a growth factor, a neurotrophin, and a neuropeptide to the injury."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_02026", "Peptide Name": "Gaegurin-6 (Gaegurin 6; GGN6; Frogs, amphibians, animals)", "Source": "Glandirana rugosa (Japanese wrinkled frog) (Rana rugosa)", "Family": "Belongs to the frog skin active peptide family (Brevinin subfamily)", "Gene": "GGN6", "Sequence": "FLPLLAGLAANFLPTIICKISYKC", "Sequence Length": 24, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P80400"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-", "Antifungal"], "Target Organism": "[Ref.7999137]Gram-positive bacteria:Micrococcus luteus (MIC=2.5 µg/ml), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC=10 µg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (MIC=10 µg/ml);Gram-negative bacteria:Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC=50 µg/ml), Shigella dysentariae (MIC=50 µg/ml), Pseudomonas putida (MIC=50 µg/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC=100 µg/ml), Eshchericia coli (MIC=50 µg/ml);Fungi:Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MIC=50 µg/ml), Candida albicans (MIC=50 µg/ml), Salmonella typhimurium (MIC=200 µg/ml), Proteus mirabilis (MIC>200 µg/ml), Serratia marcescens (MIC>200 µg/ml).", "Hemolytic Activity": "[Ref.7999137] It has 0.39% hemolytic activity at 0.1 μg/ml, 0.62% hemolytic activity at 1 μg/ml, 0.78% hemolytic activity at 10 μg/ml, 0.86% hemolytic activity at 100 μg/ml against human red blood cells", "Cytotoxicity": "No cytotoxicity information found in the reference(s) presented", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Cyclic", "N-terminal Modification": "Free", "C-terminal Modification": "Cyclization (Cys18 and Cys24)", "Stereochemistry": "L", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C125H201N27O29S2", "Mass": 2610.23, "PI": 8.86, "Net Charge": 2, "Hydrophobicity": 1.28, "Half Life": "Mammalian:1.1 hourYeast:3 minE.coli:2 min", "Function": "Has low hemolytic activity.
