Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling. Has broad-spectrum antimicrobial and antibacterial activity. It is important in the antimicrobial defenses of fish skin and possesses strong activity against saprolegnia, the most common fungal infection in fish. It is also inhibitory to fish bacterial pathogens, such as aeromonas hydrophila, vibrio alginolyticus and Escherichia coli D31.", "PTM": "Monoubiquitination at the C-terminal Lys gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation and is also prerequisite for histone H3 'Lys-4' and 'Lys-79' methylation.
