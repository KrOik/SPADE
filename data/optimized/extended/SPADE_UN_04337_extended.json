Specifically, the antimicrobial and anticancer peptides synthesized from the shortest length of Gaegurin 5, show potent antimicrobial activity against gram positive and negative strains, good safety with very low hemolytic activity and favorable advantages such as drug absorption and drug transportation due to its advantageous structural property, which can be useful as a potent antimicrobial or anticancer agent."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_04337", "Sequence": "FLXWLFKWAXK", "Sequence Length": 11, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 6 from Patent US 8076284", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "FKL", "Absent Amino Acids": "CDEGHIMNOPQRSTUVY", "Basic Residues": 2, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 7, "Polar Residues": 3, "Positive Residues": 2, "Negative Residues": 0, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_15488", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "WLF"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_24205", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "WAKKAAKIGAKLLPSVVKLFKGSGQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_24206", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "WAKKAAKIGAKALPSVVKLFKGSGQ"}]}}}
