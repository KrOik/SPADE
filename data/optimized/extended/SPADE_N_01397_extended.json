The composition can also include an effective amount of at least one of a growth factor and a neuropeptide. The present invention also relates a method of treating an injury to a nervous system of an animal that includes the steps of identifying the injury to the nervous system and applying to the injury an effective amount of at least one of antimicrobial peptide and a substance having an antimicrobial peptide effect. The method can also include applying an effective amount of one or more trophic factors selected from the group consisting of a growth factor, a neurotrophin, and a neuropeptide to the injury."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_01397", "Peptide Name": "Rugosin-A (Frogs, amphibians, animals)", "Source": "Glandirana rugosa (Japanese wrinkled frog)", "Family": "Belongs to the frog skin active peptide family (Brevinin subfamily)", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "GLLNTFKDWAISIAKGAGKGVLTTLSCKLDKSC", "Sequence Length": 33, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P80954"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "Gram-positive bacteria:Staphylococcus aureus 209P (MIC=6.25 µg/ml), Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633 (MIC=12.5 µg/ml), Micrococcus luteus ATCC9341 (MIC=25 µg/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes COOK (MIC=50 µg/ml);Gram-negative bacteria:Escherichia coli NIHJ (MIC=100 µg/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO-1 (MIC>100 µg/ml).", "Hemolytic Activity": "No hemolysis information or data found in the reference(s) presented in this entry", "Cytotoxicity": "No cytotoxicity information found in the reference(s) presented", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Cyclic", "N-terminal Modification": "Free", "C-terminal Modification": "Cyclization (Cys27 and Cys33)", "Stereochemistry": "L", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C153H256N40O45S2", "Mass": 3440.04, "PI": 9.24, "Net Charge": 3, "Hydrophobicity": 0.25, "Half Life": "Mammalian:30 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Has antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.", "Tissue specificity": "Expressed by the skin glands.", "PTM": "Contains one disulfide bond 27-33.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Isolation and characterization of novel antimicrobial peptides, rugosins A, B and C, from the skin of the frog, Rana rugosa.", "Pubmed ID": "7612013", "Reference": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1995 Jul 6;212(1)249-254.", "Author": "Suzuki S, Ohe Y, Kagegawa T, Tatemoto K.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7612013"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "KLG", "Absent Amino Acids": "EHMOPQRUY", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 2, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 18, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 2, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_01678", "Similarity": 0.7272727272727273, "Sequence": "GVLDTFKDVAIGVAKGAGTGVLKALLCKLDKSC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_01400", "Similarity": 0.6842105263157895, "Sequence": "KGAAKGLLEVASCKLSKSC"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_01741", "Similarity": 0.6666666666666666, "Sequence": "GLLDTLKNMAINAAKGAGQSVLNTLSCKLSKTC"}]}}}
