The inventors developed a novel chimeric peptide targeting cancer cells which overexpress EGFR or the like using a binding peptide such as a peptide sequence binding to EGFR, and a lytic peptide sequence, thereby solving such an object. Particularly, by using a chimeric peptide including an EGF receptor-binding peptide or the like and a cytotoxic peptide, this object was solved."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11053", "Sequence": "NYQWVPYQGRVPYPRGGLLKLLKKLLKKLLKL", "Sequence Length": 32, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 46 from Patent US 20110319336", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LKG", "Absent Amino Acids": "ACDEFHIMOSTU", "Basic Residues": 8, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 18, "Polar Residues": 16, "Positive Residues": 8, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 3824.69, "PI": 10.53, "Net Charge": 8, "Hydrophobicity": -0.35, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11038", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "NYQWVPYQGRVPYPR"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_15701", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "NYQWVPYQGRVPYPRGGLLKLLKKLLKKLLKL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_11054", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GRVPYPRGGLLKLLKKLLKKLLKL"}]}}}
