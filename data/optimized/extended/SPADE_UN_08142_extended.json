Specifically, the antimicrobial peptides derived from alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (Î±-MSH) include Î±-MSH (1â€“13) which is SYSMEHFRWGKPV, Î±-MSH (4â€“10) which is MEHFRWG, Î±-MSH (6â€“13) which is HFRWGKPV, Î±-MSH (11â€“13) which is KPV, and a KPV dimer. The ophthalmic infection can be caused by a microorganism which include a bacteria, a fungi or a virus. The vertebrate includes a bird and a mammal. The antimicrobial peptide has anti-bacterial, antifungal, and antiviral property and therefore can be administered at the onset of the ophthalmic infection before the microorganism causing the infection is determined as well as thereafter."}, {"Patent No": "US 7244710 B2", "Patent Link": "http://www.lens.org/lens/patent/US_7244710_B2", "Patent Type": "Granted Patent", "Publication Date": "2007-7-17", "Family Info": "US20040033955A1,EP0234855,WO9301211,US5028592,US5891847,US20020146374A1", "Patent Title": "Treatment Of Ophthalmic Infections Using Antimicrobial Peptides", "Abstract": "The present invention discloses a method of treating an ophthalmic infection by administering to a vertebrate inflicted with the ophthalmic infection an ophthalmologically effective amount of an antimicrobial peptide which is derived from alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and biologically functional equivalents thereof.
