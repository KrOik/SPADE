Further substitution of amino acids 8, 9 or 10 of the lycotoxin-1 wild-type amino acid sequence, specifically substituting a histidine for the phenylalanine at amino acid position 8, a glutamine for the glycine at amino acid position 10, or a serine for the leucine at amino acid position 9, provides an even greater increase in insecticidal activity. In addition to changes in the lycotoxin-1 amino acid sequence, the addition of an enterokinase K recognition site, DDDK, to the N-terminus of the lycotoxin-1 peptide increases insecticidal activity further still.
