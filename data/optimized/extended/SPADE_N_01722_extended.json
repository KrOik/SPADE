The composition can also include an effective amount of at least one of a growth factor and a neuropeptide. The present invention also relates a method of treating an injury to a nervous system of an animal that includes the steps of identifying the injury to the nervous system and applying to the injury an effective amount of at least one of antimicrobial peptide and a substance having an antimicrobial peptide effect. The method can also include applying an effective amount of one or more trophic factors selected from the group consisting of a growth factor, a neurotrophin, and a neuropeptide to the injury."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_N_01722", "Peptide Name": "Brevinin-2Ee (Frogs, amphibians, animals)", "Source": "Rana esculenta (Edible frog) (Pelophylax esculentus)", "Family": "Belongs to the frog skin active peptide family (Brevinin subfamily)", "Gene": "Not found", "Sequence": "GIFDKLKNFAKGVAQSLLNKASCKLSGQC", "Sequence Length": 29, "UniProt Entry": ["http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P40841"], "Protein Existence": "Protein level", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial", "Anti-Gram+", "Anti-Gram-"], "Target Organism": "[Swiss_Prot Entry P40841]Shows antibacterial activity against representative Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species", "Hemolytic Activity": "[Ref.8163497]LC50>100 ÂµM against human erythrocytes", "Cytotoxicity": "Not included yet", "Binding Target": "Not found", "Linear/Cyclic": "Not included yet", "N-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "C-terminal Modification": "Not included yet", "Stereochemistry": "Not included yet", "Structure Description": "Not found", "Formula": "C135H226N38O39S2", "Mass": 3069.6, "PI": 9.6, "Net Charge": 4, "Hydrophobicity": -0.02, "Half Life": "Mammalian:30 hourYeast:>20 hourE.coli:>10 hour", "Function": "Shows antibacterial activity against representative Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species, and hemolytic activity", "Literature": [{"Title": "Antimicrobial peptides from skin secretions of Rana esculenta.
