The inventors developed a novel chimeric peptide targeting cancer cells which overexpress EGFR or the like using a binding peptide such as a peptide sequence binding to EGFR, and a lytic peptide sequence, thereby solving such an object. Particularly, by using a chimeric peptide including an EGF receptor-binding peptide or the like and a cytotoxic peptide, this object was solved."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11057", "Sequence": "ALVRYKDPLFVWGFL", "Sequence Length": 15, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 53 from Patent US 20110319336", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Anticancer"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LFV", "Absent Amino Acids": "CEHIMNOQSTU", "Basic Residues": 2, "Acidic Residues": 1, "Hydrophobic Residues": 11, "Polar Residues": 6, "Positive Residues": 2, "Negative Residues": 1, "Mass": 1824.17, "PI": 8.63, "Net Charge": 1, "Hydrophobicity": 0.74, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_01255", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GFLDKLKKGASDFANALVNSIKGT"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_12113", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GFLEKLKKGAKDFASALVNSIKGT"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_19693", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GFLEKLKKGAKDFASALVNSIKGT"}]}}}
