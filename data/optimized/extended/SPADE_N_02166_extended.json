Exhibits diverse biological activities, such as hemolysis, edema, apoptosis, as well as induction of platelet aggregation. Effects of snake L-amino oxidases on platelets are controversial, since they either induce aggregation or inhibit agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions. Unlike other snake venom L-amino acid oxidases, does not induce hemorrhage. This protein may also have antibacterial and antiparasitic activities.", "Catalytic activity": "An L-amino acid + H2O + O2 = a 2-oxo acid + NH3 + H2O2.", "Subunit structure": "Homodimer; non-covalently linked.", "Tissue specificity": "Expressed by the venom gland.", "Literature": [{"Title": "Isolation, structural, and functional characterization of an apoptosis-inducing L-amino acid oxidase from leaf-nosed viper (Eristocophis macmahoni) snake venom.", "Pubmed ID": "11368308", "Reference": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 2000 Dec 15;384(2)216-226.", "Author": "Ali SA, Stoeva S, Abbasi A, Alam JM, Kayed R, Faigle M, Neumeister B, Voelter W.", "URL": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11368308"}], "Frequent Amino Acids": "EAD", "Absent Amino Acids": "CHMOQSTUW", "Basic Residues": 3, "Acidic Residues": 8, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 11, "Positive Residues": 3, "Negative Residues": 8, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_UN_00236", "Similarity": 0.9230769230769231, "Sequence": "ADDKNPLEEFRETNYEVFLEIAKNGLKATSNPKRVVIVGAGMAGLSAAY"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02162", "Similarity": 0.8888888888888888, "Sequence": "ADDKNPLEECFREDDYEGFLEIAKNGLSTTSNPKRVVIVGAGMSGLAAY"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02170", "Similarity": 0.8888888888888888, "Sequence": "ADDKNPLEECFREDDYEEFLEIAKNGLKKTSNPKHIVYPVKPSEQLYEESLRDQLPTSMHRYPSMIQKIFFAGEYTANAHGWIDSTIK"}]}}}
