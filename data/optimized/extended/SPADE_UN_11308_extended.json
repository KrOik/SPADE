The present invention further concerns the use of such agents for the treatment of bacterial infections in animals, including man. The agents are derivatives of vancomycin-type antibiotics, of structure: V-L-W-X; wherein V is a glycopeptide moiety which inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis in bacteria; L is a linking group; W is a peptidic membrane-associating element such as an element based on naturally-occurring animal or bacterial peptide antibiotics; and X is hydrogen or a membrane-insertive element."}], "Sequence Information": {"SPADE ID": "SPADE_UN_11308", "Sequence": "GIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISWIKRKRQQC", "Sequence Length": 27, "Peptide Name": "Sequence 3 from Patent US 7078380", "Source": "Synthetic construct", "Biological Activity": ["Antimicrobial", "Antibacterial"], "Frequent Amino Acids": "LGI", "Absent Amino Acids": "DEFHMNOUY", "Basic Residues": 5, "Acidic Residues": 0, "Hydrophobic Residues": 13, "Polar Residues": 15, "Positive Residues": 5, "Negative Residues": 0, "Mass": 2950.59, "PI": 11.11, "Net Charge": 5, "Hydrophobicity": 0.36, "Similar Sequences": [{"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_02602", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISWIKRKRQQ"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_05970", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "GIGAVLKVL"}, {"SPADE_ID": "SPADE_N_06727", "Similarity": 1.0, "Sequence": "KIAKVALAKLGIGAVLKVLTTGL"}]}}}
